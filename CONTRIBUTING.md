# Contributing to ToolJet
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## Setup 

[Mac OS](https://docs.tooljet.io/docs/contributing-guide/setup/Mac%20OS)
[Docker](https://docs.tooljet.io/docs/contributing-guide/setup/docker)
[Ubuntu](https://docs.tooljet.io/docs/contributing-guide/setup/ubuntu)

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## First-time contributors
We've tagged some issues to make it easy to get started :)
[Good first issues](https://github.com/ToolJet/ToolJet/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
Looking for ReactJS issues? Check out our [Frontend issues](https://github.com/ToolJet/ToolJet/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afrontend)

Add a comment on the issue and wait for the issue to be assigned before you start working on it. This helps to avoid multiple people working on similar issues.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Git-Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`. Please create the branch in the format feature/<issue-id>-<issue-name> (eg: feature/176-chart-widget)
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the AGPL v3 License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [AGPL v3 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/ToolJet/ToolJet/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
