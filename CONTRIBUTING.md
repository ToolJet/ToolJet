# Contributing to ToolJet 🚀  
We love your input! 💬 We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- 🐛 Reporting a bug

- ✨ Proposing new features

## We Develop with GitHub 👩‍💻👨‍💻  
We use GitHub to host code, track issues, and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## First-time Contributors 🎉  
We've tagged some issues to make it easy to get started 😊:  
[Good first issues](https://github.com/ToolJet/ToolJet/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)

If you're interested in working on an issue, make sure it has either a `good-first-issue` or `up-for-grabs` label added. 📝 Add a comment on the issue and wait for it to be assigned before you start working on it. This helps to avoid multiple people working on similar issues.

## We Use [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) 🔄, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests 📥  
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Git-Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. 🍴 Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`. Please create the branch in the format `feature/<issue-id>-<issue-name>` (e.g., `feature/176-chart-widget`).
2. 🧪 If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. 📖 If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. ✅ Ensure the test suite passes.
5. ✍️ Make sure your code lints.
6. 🚀 Issue that pull request!

## Any Contributions You Make Will Be Under the AGPL v3 License 📜  
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [AGPL v3 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html) that covers the project.

## Report Bugs Using GitHub's [Issues](https://github.com/ToolJet/ToolJet/issues) 🐞  
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/ToolJet/ToolJet/issues/new/choose). It's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- 📝 A quick summary and/or background  
- 🛠 Steps to reproduce  
  - Be specific!  
  - 💡 Give a sample code if you can.  
- 🤔 What you expected would happen  
- ⚠️ What actually happens  
- 📝 Notes (including why you think this might be happening, or things you've tried that didn’t work)
