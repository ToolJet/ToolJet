You can preview your app by clicking on the `Preview` icon on the top-right of the App-Builder.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/v2-beta/app-builder/preview/preview-mode.png" alt="App In Preview Mode"/>
</div>

Once you are in preview mode, you can change preview settings to test the app in different settings. Change the version of the app and switch between different versions to see how they compare. You can also select **Mobile** or **Desktop** view to see how the components are displayed in different screen settings.
