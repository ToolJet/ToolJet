## Component Config Inspector

The Component Config Inspector is also called as component inspector. It contains all the available settings for the selected component and is where you **set values**, **update component names**, and **create event handlers**. The Component Inspector organizes settings into different sections, such as **Property** and **Styles**. 

To open the Component Config Inspector, click on the **[component handle](/docs/app-builder/canvas#arrange-components)** that is present on the top of the component including **⚙️ + Component Name** and the component inspector will open up on the right side:
