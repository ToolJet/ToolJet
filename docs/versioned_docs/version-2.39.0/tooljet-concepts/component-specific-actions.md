Component Specific Actions are specialized actions that are unique to each component, meaning they can perform tasks that are specific only to that component. For instance, the **Text Input** component has its own set of specific actions like `setText` that allows us to set the value of the component. Component Specific Actions actions can be triggered in two ways: through event handlers or by executing RunJS code.
