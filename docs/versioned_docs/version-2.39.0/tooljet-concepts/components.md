Components in ToolJet serve as the building blocks for creating applications. They are pre-designed elements that you can drag and drop onto the canvas in the App-Builder. ToolJet comes with 45+ built-in components.

</div>

These components range from basic UI elements like buttons, text fields, and tables, to more complex elements like kanban, charts, and maps. By using components, you can quickly assemble a functional and visually appealing application without having to write code from scratch.

### Customizing Components

Components are highly customizable and interactive. Once you place a component on the canvas, you can easily modify its properties, styles, and behaviors through the properties panel on the right side of the App-Builder. This allows you to make your application dynamic and responsive.

### Using Components With Data

In ToolJet, components can be easily connected to various data sources like databases, APIs, and third-party services through **[queries](what-are-queries)**. Once the data is fetched, you can bind it to components like tables, charts, and more.

## Custom Components

ToolJet allows for the creation of custom components using React. This feature is invaluable for developers who require functionalities beyond the 45+ built-in components that ToolJet offers. To create a custom component, you can drag and drop a **[Custom Component](/docs/widgets/custom-component/)** on the canvas and configure its data and code. 

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/tooljet-concepts/what-are-components/custom-components.png" alt="Custom Components" />
</div>
By incorporating custom React components, you can significantly extend the capabilities of your ToolJet applications, allowing for a more tailored and unique user experience.
