# Slack Code of Conduct

This code of conduct governs ToolJet's Slack Community events and discussions.

---

## Introduction

- Diversity and inclusion make our community strong. We encourage participation from the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible and want to be very clear about where we stand.

- Our goal is to maintain a safe, helpful and friendly community for everyone, regardless of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other defining characteristic.

- This code and related procedures apply to unacceptable behavior occurring in all community venues, including behavior outside the scope of community activities — online and in-person— as well as in all one-on-one communications, and anywhere such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

## Expected behavior

- Be welcoming.
- Be kind.
- Look out for each other.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Conduct or speech which might be considered sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory or offensive in nature.
  - Do not use unwelcome, suggestive, derogatory or inappropriate nicknames or terms.
  - Do not show disrespect towards others. (Jokes, innuendo, dismissive attitudes.)
- Intimidation or harassment (online or in-person).
- Disrespect towards differences of opinion.
- Inappropriate attention or contact. Be aware of how your actions affect others. If it makes someone uncomfortable, stop.
- Not understanding the differences between constructive criticism and disparagement.
- Sustained disruptions.
- Violence, threats of violence or violent language.

## Where does the Code of Conduct apply?

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by ToolJet. This includes:

- Conferences (including social events and peripheral activities)
- Unconferences and sprints
- Meetups, including their discussion boards
- Workshops
- Presentation materials used in talks or sessions
- Slack
- GitHub
- Twitter hashtag and mentions
- Any forums created by the ToolJet which the community uses for communication.

The Code of Conduct does not exclusively apply to slack or events on an official agenda. For example, if after a scheduled social event you go to a bar with a group of fellow participants, and someone harasses you there, we would still treat that as a CoC violation. Similarly, harassment in Twitter direct messages related to ToolJet can still be covered under this Code of Conduct.

In addition, violations of this code outside our spaces may affect a person’s ability to participate in them.

## Enforcement

- Understand that speech and actions have consequences, and unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated.
- If you are the subject of, or witness to any violations of this Code of Conduct, please contact us via email at hello@tooljet.com or dm @navaneeth on slack.
- If violations occur, organizers will take any action they deem appropriate for the infraction, up to and including expulsion.
