### Read Data 

The following example demonstrates how to read data from a table in the connected Redshift cluster. The query selects all the columns from the `employee` table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee 
```

### Write Data

```sql
UPDATE employee
SET first_name = 'Glenn',
    last_name = 'Jacobs'
WHERE employee_id = 8;
```
