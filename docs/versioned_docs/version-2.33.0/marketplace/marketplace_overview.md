# Marketplace: Overview

With ToolJet Marketplace, ToolJet users can conveniently add custom plugins (data sources) to their workspaces. This feature enables users to create plugins that cater to their specific needs and integrate them seamlessly with ToolJet.

## Enabling Marketplace 

To **Enable** the marketplace feature, users need to add the following environment variable to their **[`.env`](/docs/setup/env-vars#marketplace)** file:

```bash
ENABLE_MARKETPLACE_FEATURE=true
```

When running ToolJet locally, ensure that all the plugins are available by building marketplace before starting the server.

The logged-in user should be an **Administrator** to access the marketplace page.

## Installing a plugin

To navigate to the Marketplace page, click on the settings icon on the bottom left of the dashboard, and click on **Marketplace** from the selection menu.

The Marketplace page will contain two tabs: **Installed** and **Marketplace**. 

Under the **Marketplace** tab, you will see a list of all the available plugins that can be installed on the workspace. To install a plugin, click on the **Install** button on the plugin's card. Once the installation is complete, the status will change from Install to **Installed**.
