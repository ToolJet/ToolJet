ToolJet can connect to Google Calendar to fetch, create, update, and delete calendar events directly from your ToolJet application.

## Connection

You will need the following credential to connect with Google Calendar:
 - **Client ID**
 - **Client Secret**

These credentials are used to authenticate via OAuth2 and access calendar data securely. You can review all available permission scopes [here](https://developers.google.com/workspace/calendar/api/auth).

You can toggle on **Authentication required for all users** in the configuration. When enabled, users will be redirected to the OAuth consent screen the first time a query from this data source is triggered in the application. This ensures each user connects their own Google Calendar account securely.
