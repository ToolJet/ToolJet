# Deploying ToolJet on Azure container apps

:::warning
To enable ToolJet AI features in your ToolJet deployment, whitelist https://api-gateway.tooljet.ai.
:::

:::info
Please note that you need to set up a **PostgreSQL database** manually to be used by ToolJet. 

ToolJet comes with a **built-in Redis setup**, which is used for multiplayer editing and background jobs. However, for **multi-pod setup**, it's recommended to use an **external Redis instance**.
:::

## Deploying ToolJet application

1. Open the Azure dashboard at https://portal.azure.com, navigate to Container Apps, and click on "Create container app".

2. Select the appropriate subscription and provide basic details such as the container name.

3. Select "Create new environment" to configure the basic networking setup.

    Now, letâ€™s proceed to the Networking section for detailed configuration steps. Please update the configurations as shown below:
    :::tip
    The Container app, the PostgreSQL server, and the Redis server all should be in the same virtual network (VNet).
    :::
    <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/setup/azure-container/step3-2.png" alt="Deploying ToolJet on Azure container apps" />
    Create and exit.

4. In the container tab, uncheck the "Use quickstart image" option to select the image source manually.
    <img className="screenshot-full img-m" src="/img/setup/azure-container/step3-v2.png" alt="Deploying ToolJet on Azure container apps" />
    - Make sure to provide the image tag, and then enter `server/entrypoint.sh, npm, run, start:prod` in the "Arguments override" field.
    - Add the following ToolJet application variables under the "Environmental variable" section. You can refer to this [**documentation**](/docs/setup/env-vars) for more information on environment variables.

5. Under environmental variables, please add the below ToolJet application variables:
    ```env
    TOOLJET_HOST=<Endpoint url>
    LOCKBOX_MASTER_KEY=<generate using 'openssl rand -hex 32'>
    SECRET_KEY_BASE=<generate using 'openssl rand -hex 64'>

    PG_USER=<username>
    PG_HOST=<postgresql-instance-ip>
    PG_PASS=<password>
    PG_DB=tooljet_production # Must be a unique database name (do not reuse across deployments)
    ```
    Update the `TOOLJET_HOST` environment variable to reflect the default host assigned by Azure Container Apps, if you're not using a custom domain.

    If using Azure Database for Postgresql-Flexible server, also add:
   
    ```env
    PGSSLMODE = require
    ```


## ToolJet Database

Use the ToolJet-hosted database to build apps faster, and manage your data with ease. You can learn more about this feature [here](/docs/tooljet-db/tooljet-database).

Deploying ToolJet Database is mandatory from ToolJet 3.0 or else the migration might break. Checkout the following docs to know more about new major version, including breaking changes that require you to adjust your applications accordingly:

- [ToolJet 3.0 Migration Guide for Self-Hosted Versions](./upgrade-to-v3.md)

#### Setting Up ToolJet Database

To set up ToolJet Database, the following **environment variables are mandatory** and must be configured:

```env
TOOLJET_DB=tooljet_db # Must be a unique database name (separate from PG_DB and not shared)
TOOLJET_DB_HOST=<postgresql-database-host>
TOOLJET_DB_USER=<username>
TOOLJET_DB_PASS=<password>
```

:::note 
Ensure that `TOOLJET_DB` is not the same as `PG_DB`. Both databases must be uniquely named and not shared.
:::


Additionally, for **PostgREST**, the following **mandatory** environment variables must be set:

   :::tip
    If you have openssl installed, you can run the 
    command `openssl rand -hex 32` to generate the value for `PGRST_JWT_SECRET`.

If this parameter is not specified, PostgREST will refuse authentication requests.
:::

```env
 PGRST_HOST=localhost:3001
 PGRST_LOG_LEVEL=info
 PGRST_DB_PRE_CONFIG=postgrest.pre_config
 PGRST_SERVER_PORT=3001
 PGRST_DB_URI=
 PGRST_JWT_SECRET=
```

The **`PGRST_DB_URI`** variable is **required** for PostgREST, which exposes the database as a REST API. This must be explicitly set for proper functionality.

#### Format:

```env
 PGRST_DB_URI=postgres://TOOLJET_DB_USER:TOOLJET_DB_PASS@TOOLJET_DB_HOST:5432/TOOLJET_DB
```

**Ensure these configurations are correctly set up before proceeding with the ToolJet deployment. Make sure these environment variables are set in the same environment as the ToolJet container.**

**Note:** These environment variables are in general and might change in the future. You can also refer env variable [**here**](/docs/setup/env-vars).

6. In the ingress tab, configure Ingress and Authentication settings as shown below. You can customize the security configurations as per your requirements. Make sure the port is set to 3000.
    <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/setup/azure-container/step4.png" alt="Deploying ToolJet on Azure container apps" />

7. Click on "Review + create" and wait for the template to be verified and passed, as shown in the screenshot below.
    <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/setup/azure-container/step5a-v2.png" alt="Deploying ToolJet on Azure container apps" />

8. Once the container is deployed, you can verify its status under revision management.

You can access ToolJet via the application URL provided in the overview tab.

## Upgrading to the Latest LTS Version

New LTS versions are released every 3-5 months with an end-of-life of atleast 18 months. To check the latest LTS version, visit the [ToolJet Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tooljet/tooljet/tags) page. The LTS tags follow a naming convention with the prefix `LTS-` followed by the version number, for example `tooljet/tooljet:ee-lts-latest`.

If this is a new installation of the application, you may start directly with the latest version. This guide is not required for new installations.

#### Prerequisites for Upgrading to the Latest LTS Version:

- It is crucial to perform a **comprehensive backup of your database** before starting the upgrade process to prevent data loss.

- Users on versions earlier than **v2.23.0-ee2.10.2** must first upgrade to this version before proceeding to the LTS version.
