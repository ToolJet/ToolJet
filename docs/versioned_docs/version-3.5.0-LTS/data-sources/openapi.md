OpenAPI is a specification for designing and documenting RESTful APIs. Using OpenAPI datasource, ToolJet can generate REST API operations from OpenAPI Specs.

## Connection

Connections are created based on OpenAPI specifications. The available authentication methods currently supported are Basic Auth, API Key, Bearer Token, and OAuth 2.0. It is also possible to use specifications that require multiple authentications. Learn more [here](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/).

OpenAPI datasource accepts specifications in JSON or YAML format only. After providing a valid JSON or YAML spec and selecting OAuth2 as the authentication type, you can enter custom headers and client credentials.
