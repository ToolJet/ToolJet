## What is ToolJet

ToolJet is an **open-source low-code framework** to build and deploy custom internal tools. 

ToolJet ships with its built-in database called **[ToolJet DB](/docs/tooljet-database)** (built on top of PostgreSQL). You can also connect to the **external data sources** such as **databases** ( PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MS SQL Server, Snowflake, , BigQuery, etc ), **API/GraphQL endpoints**, **SaaS tools** ( Airtable, Stripe, Google Sheets, etc ) and **cloud object storage services** ( AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage and Minio ). 

Once the data sources are connected, ToolJet can run **queries** on these data sources to fetch and update data. The data fetched from data sources can be **visualised and modified** using the UI widgets such as tables, charts, forms, etc. You can also use **[Javascript](/docs/data-sources/run-js)** or **[Python](/docs/data-sources/run-py)** queries for writing business logic or interacting with the user interface of the application.

<!-- Why ToolJet section is commented out.

## Why ToolJet

When you're building an internal tool, there are a lot of tools and frameworks available. But with ToolJet, you can save developers' hours by allowing them to build full-stack business applications in minutes.

- **Open-Source**: ToolJet is Open-Source, you can go through the ToolJet codebase on **[GitHub](https://github.com/ToolJet/ToolJet)** or you can **deploy ToolJet on your infrastructure**.
- **Full-stack platform**: ToolJet has a **[built-in database](/docs/tooljet-database)**, **[External datasources](/docs/data-sources/airtable)**, and a frontend builder so you can build a full-stack app right inside it. ToolJet comes with Custom Component for importing your own **react components** and the ability to write custom **JavaScript** and **Python** code.
- **Extensible**: Didn't find the **component** or **datasource** that fit your application's requirements? You can always build your own **component** and **datasource** using our **plugin development kit**.
- **Powerful Apps**: With ToolJet, developers can quickly build powerful custom internal tools for their Support, Operations and Sales teams. Build CRUD apps, Dashboards, Admin Panels, CRMs and much more.

## How ToolJet works

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

<img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/v2-beta/getting_started/howtjworks.webp" width="100%" height="100%" alt="How ToolJet works flow" />

</div>

**With ToolJet, you can build apps in 3 simple steps:**

1. **Connect to datasources:** Connect to the ToolJet's built-in database **[ToolJet DB](/docs/tooljet-database)** (built on top of PostgreSQL) or your existing data sources such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, Firestore, Stripe, Google Sheets, API endpoints, etc.

2. **Build queries:** ToolJet comes with query builders for all supported data sources. You can also write **[Javascript](/docs/data-sources/run-js)** or **[Python](/docs/data-sources/run-py)** queries or use **[Transformations](/docs/tutorial/transformations)** to transform the query response.

3. **Build User Interface:** ToolJet's visual **[App Builder](/docs/app-builder/overview)** allows you to drag and drop components ( Eg: tables, charts, forms, etc ) to quickly build the user-interface of the apps. Components have events such as `on click`, `on row selected`, `on page changed`, etc. ToolJet apps can be used in light and dark mode.

    :::tip
    ToolJet binds together the datasources, queries and components to convert business logic into custom applications. You can also secure your ToolJet apps with **[Group & Permissions](/docs/org-management/permissions)** and **[Audit Logging](/docs/Enterprise/audit_logs)**.

## Quickstart Guide

In this quickstart guide, we'll cover the fundamentals of ToolJet by building a **Time Tracking Application** that will allow end-users to record their daily working hours with supporting details. 

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img style={{padding: '10px'}} className="screenshot-full" src="/img/quickstart-guide/time-tracker-final-preview.png" alt="Application Preview" />
</div>

If you don't already have a ToolJet account, head over to **[tooljet.com](https://tooljet.com)** to sign up for free. Existing users can simply log in.

### Create Database Table

We'll first create a table in ToolJet's built-in **[database](/docs/tooljet-database)**. 

Navigate to the **Database** tab from the left sidebar. Click on the **Create new table** button on the top-left. A dialog box will slide from the right to configure the database table properties. 

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-between', alignItems:'center'}}>
  <div style={{flex: 1, padding: '0', alignment:'center'}}>
    <p style={{textAlign: 'left'}}>
        In the <b>Table name</b> field, enter <i>timeTracker</i>.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The <b>id</b> field will be present by default to create a unique identifier for each record in our database table.
        <br/>    
        <br/>    
        Click on the <b>Add more columns</b> button and enter <b>employee</b> in the Name field and select <b>varchar</b> as the Type.
        <br/>    
        <br/>    
        Similarly, add four more columns:<br/><br/>    
          - Name: <b>taskname</b> | Type: <b>varchar</b> <br/><br/>
          - Name: <b>duration</b> | Type: <b>integer</b> <br/><br/>
          - Name: <b>dateoftask</b> | Type: <b>varchar</b> <br/><br/>
          - Name: <b>description</b> | Type: <b>varchar</b> 
        <br/>    
        <br/>  
        Click on the <b>Create</b> button on the bottom right to create the table.         
    </p>
  </div>
  <div style={{flex: 1, padding: '10px'}}>
    <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/quickstart-guide/database-setup.png" alt="ToolJet Database Table" />
  </div>
</div>
<br/>

For every column, you can choose from four data types - **varchar** for text, **integer** for numbers,  **float** for decimal or fractional numbers and **boolean** for true or false values. The **Default** field allows you to enter a default value that will be used if no value is received from the frontend.

Add three rows of dummy data by clicking on the **Add New Row** button and entering the required values. We are entering email IDs for the employee column. Later, we'll use this **employee column** to display data specific to the logged-in user.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img style={{padding: '10px'}} className="screenshot-full" src="/img/quickstart-guide/dummy-data.png" alt="Add Dummy Data" />
</div>

### Create UI For Home Page Using ToolJet App-Builder

We'll now go ahead and build the Home page of our application using the **ToolJet** **[App-Builder](/docs/app-builder/overview)**. 

Click on the **Dashboard** button on the sidebar and click on the **Create new app** button. A new application will be created with an empty canvas. 

We can see the **Component Library** on the right, we can drag and drop pre-built components from the **Component Library** on the canvas to create the UI. The **Query Panel** at the bottom can be used to create and manage queries to interact with the database. 

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img style={{padding: '10px'}} className="screenshot-full" src="/img/quickstart-guide/app-builder-overview.png" alt="App-Builder Overview" />
</div>

Rename the application to *Time Tracker*. Minimize the Query Panel by clicking on the **Hide Query Panel** button on its top-left. 

Click and drag a **[Container](/docs/widgets/container)** component to the canvas. Adjust the borders of the **Container** and expand it till it covers the visible portion of the canvas. 

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img style={{padding: '10px'}} className="screenshot-full" src="/img/quickstart-guide/drag-drop-container.gif" alt="Drag and Drop Container" />
</div>

Each time you click and select the **Container** or any other component on the canvas, configuration related to the component will appear on the right. 

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-between', alignItems:'center'}}>
  <div style={{flex: 1, padding: '0', alignment:'center'}}>
    <p style={{textAlign: 'left'}}>
        Each component will show a different configuration based on its overall functionality.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Right at the top is an input field that lets us name the component. We'll click on it and rename the container to <i>home</i>.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Below we have the <b>Properties</b> and <b>Styles</b> tab.
        <br/>    
        <br/>    
        <b>Properties</b> tab lets us configure the functional behaviour of a component.
        <br/>    
        <br/>    
        <b>Style</b> tab allows us to add custom styling to the components.    
      </p>
  </div>
  <div style={{flex: 1, padding: '10px'}}>
    <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/quickstart-guide/container-config.png" alt="Container Configuration" />
  </div>
</div>
<br/>

We'll give each component in this application a name that reflects its function. This naming strategy will become increasingly beneficial as the application expands and we need to identify specific components.

Let's build the header of our application. Click and drag an **[Image](/docs/widgets/image)** component to the canvas from the library and rename it to *Logo*. Select the Image component, you'll see its configuration on the right. 
Enter the below value as **URL**:

```js
https://static-00.iconduck.com/assets.00/tooljet-icon-1024x908-0mi0u3op.png
```

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img style={{padding: '10px'}} className="screenshot-full" src="/img/quickstart-guide/image-config.png" alt="Image Component Configuration" />
</div>

<i>Feel free to add any other URL that you might wish to use as the logo.</i>
<br/><br/>

Place a **[Text](docs/widgets/text)** component next to it and rename the component to *headerText*. Paste following value under **Text** property:

```js
Time Tracker Application⏳
```
<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img style={{padding: '10px'}} className="screenshot-full" src="/img/quickstart-guide/text-config.png" alt="Text Component Configuration" />
</div>

Under **Styles**, change the **Text Size** to 25. We are now ready with the Header of the application. 

Next we'll use a **[Table](/docs/widgets/table)** component to display all the time tracker logs. The **Table** component offers a simple and intuitive way to display and interact with data. 

Drag and drop a table component on the canvas. Adjust the width and make it slightly wider than the header. The default name of the table will be *table1*, rename it to *trackerTable*. We already have some dummy data in the **Table** component. We'll replace it with actual data later on. 

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img style={{padding: '10px'}} className="screenshot-full" src="/img/quickstart-guide/rename-table.png" alt="Drag and Drop Table Component" />
</div>

### Create Your First Query In ToolJet

It's time to add some real data to our application. 

Click on the **Show Query Panel** button on the top-left of the **Query Panel** to expand it. Click on the **+Add** and select **ToolJet Database** - a new query will be created. Rename the query to *getTrackerSummary*. Select *timeTracker* (the database table that we had created at the start) as the Table name and **List Rows** as Operations. 

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img style={{padding: '10px'}} className="screenshot-full" src="/img/quickstart-guide/first-query.gif" alt="Create a Get Query" />
</div>

Enable **Run this query on load?** toggle, this will ensure that the query runs every time the application loads. We'll generally use this setting for queries that are used to fetch data. Click on the **Run** button to run the query. 

To see the preview of the returned data, press on the **Preview** button in the **Query Panel**. 

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img style={{padding: '10px'}} className="screenshot-full" src="/img/quickstart-guide/query-preview.png" alt="Query Preview" />
</div>

### Adding Queried Data To The Table

We need to use double curly braces `{{}}` to write custom JavaScript code or access values such as query results, component variables and other variables available in the ToolJet App-Builder.

The general format to access queries is:

```js
{{queries.queryName.data}}
```

A quick way to look at available queries (and other accessible values) would be to click on the **Inspector** button in the left side-bar and expand the **queries** dropdown. 

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img style={{padding: '10px'}} className="screenshot-full" src="/img/quickstart-guide/inspector.gif" alt="Inspector" />
</div>


We can use the queried data in our components. Let's insert the data returned by the *getTrackerSummary* query in our table. Hide the query panel and click on the **Table** component. Under the **Data** property, paste the below code:

```js
{{queries.getTrackerSummary.data}}
```

We've now replaced the static data with dynamic data that we are fetching from the database. The table now displays data fetched using the *getTrackerSummary* query. 

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img style={{padding: '10px'}} className="screenshot-full" src="/img/quickstart-guide/table-with-data.png" alt="Table With Queried Data" />
</div>

Let's make some more changes in the **Table** configuration. Disable all the properties under **Search sort and filter** and **Additional Actions**. We don't need them for our use-case.

### Creating Form To Submit Data

The **Modal** component can be used to create a pop-up form to submit data. 

Drag a **[Modal](/docs/widgets/modal)** component from the components library and place it at the bottom-right of the table - you will notice that only a button with the label **Launch Modal** shows up on the canvas. We'll first change the name of the button to *logTimeButton* and **Trigger Button label** property to **Log Time**. 

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img style={{padding: '10px'}} className="screenshot-full" src="/img/quickstart-guide/modal-button-config.png" alt="Modal Button Configuration" />
</div>


To edit the modal, click on the **Log Time** button(named *Launch Modal* earlier) - a modal will open up on your canvas. The modal will stay open till you click on the `X` button/close button on the top-right. You can edit the modal and place other components over it while it is open. We'll place components on our modal to create a form layout to submit the time tracker details.

Let's change the **Title** property of the modal to *Log Details*. Click on the back button/`←` on the top-left of Modal component's configuration and go back to the components library. 

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img style={{padding: '10px'}} className="screenshot-full" src="/img/quickstart-guide/change-modal-label.gif" alt="Modal Label Change" />
</div>

Drag four **[Text](/docs/widgets/text)** components on the modal and align them vertically. We'll rename the components and their labels according to the table below: 

| Component       | Component Name | Text property            |
|:----------------|:-------------------|:-----------------|
| Text            |taskName           | Task Name        |
| Text            |duration           | Duration (In Hours)        |
| Text            |dateOfTask         | Date Of Task     |
| Text            |taskDescription    | Task Description |

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img style={{padding: '10px'}} className="screenshot-full" src="/img/quickstart-guide/modal-text-labels.png" alt="Modal Text Labels" />
</div>

We are ready with the labels, let's place the input components next to the labels. Drag **[Text Input](/docs/widgets/text-input)**, **[Number Input](/docs/widgets/number-input)**, **[Date Picker](/docs/widgets/datepicker)** and **[Textarea](/docs/widgets/textarea)** components and arrange them next to the labels. You'll find all the input fields under the **Form** section of the component library. We'll also add a **Submit** button below the input fields. Refer to the below table to rename the component name and default values:

| Component  | Component Name  | Default Value           |
|:----------------|:-------------------|:-----------------|
| Text Input      | taskNameInput      | Development      |
| Number Input    | taskDurationInput  | 1         |
| Date Picker     | taskDateInput      | {{moment().format("DD/MM/YYYY")}}|
| Textarea        | taskDescriptionInput| Creating a modal component |

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img style={{padding: '10px'}} className="screenshot-full" src="/img/quickstart-guide/modal-with-inputs.png" alt="Modal With Input Fields" />
</div>

For the **Date Picker** field, we are using double curly braces to pass JavaScript code. Using the **Moment.js** library, we are getting today's date in the dd/mm/yyyy format. ToolJet comes with **Moment.js**, **Lodash** and **Axios** libraries to make it more convenient for you to work with custom JavaScript code.

We'll close the modal by clicking on the `X`/close button on the top-right. 

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img style={{padding: '10px'}} className="screenshot-full" src="/img/quickstart-guide/open-close-modal.gif" alt="Open and Close the Modal Component" />
</div>

### Creating Query To Write Data 

We are ready with the form. Now we need to create a query that will help us add new entries to the *timeTracker* table in the database. Click on the **+ Add** button in the Query Panel. Select **ToolJet Database** from the list of available sources. 

Rename the query to *addLog*, select **Create row** as Operations and use the below configuration for the columns. We'll see how we can use custom code and use different keys to access the data available in the app-builder in the below table. 

| Column Name    | Keys                | 
| :-------------- | :------------------------ |
| employee       | {{globals.currentUser.email}}  |
| taskname       | {{components.taskNameInput.value}}  |
| duration       | {{components.taskDurationInput.value}}  |
| dateoftask       | {{components.taskDateInput.value}}  |
| taskdescription       | {{components.taskDescriptionInput.value}}  |

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img style={{padding: '10px'}} className="screenshot-full" src="/img/quickstart-guide/add-log-config.png" alt="Configuration for the addLog query" />
</div>


Click on the **Inspector** on the left-sidebar to look at the available values under **globals** and **components**. 

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-between', alignItems:'center'}}>
  <div style={{flex: 1, padding: '0', alignment:'center'}}>
    <p style={{textAlign: 'left'}}>
        The <b>currentUser</b> object holds all the values related to logged-in user.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        You can refer to the logged-in user's firstName, lastName, email and groups using the <b>currentUser</b> object. 
        <br/>    
        <br/>    
        Similarly, the <b>components</b> object holds all the values related to the components in our application. 
        <br/>    
        <br/>    
        Now every time the <i>addLog</i> query runs, the values present in the referred keys will be written to the database.
      </p>
  </div>
  <div style={{flex: 1, padding: '10px'}}>
    <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/quickstart-guide/inspector-objects.png" alt="Details in the Inspector Objects" />
  </div>
</div>
<br/>

Later, we'll plug this query to the **Submit** button on *logTimeModal*.

### Using Events

**Events** allow us to run queries and other application functions based on button clicks, query completion and an array of other triggers.

The *addLog* query will add data to the the *timeTracker* table in the database when it runs. But we would want our **Table** component to be reloaded with the new data every time we add or delete the entries. Since the data in the **Table** component is coming from the *getTrackerSummary* query, we'll trigger the *getTrackerSummary* query after running the *addLog* query.

Click on the **+ New Event Handler** button in the *addLog* query - a new event will be added. Click on the event and select **Run Query** as Action and *getTrackerSummary* as Query. 

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img style={{padding: '10px'}} className="screenshot-full" src="/img/quickstart-guide/query-success-event.png" alt="Configuration for the addLog query" />
</div>

Now the *getTrackerSummary* will run every time the *addLog* query is successfully executed, the **Table** component will also get updated with the new data since it displays the data returned by the *getTrackerSummary*. 

It's time to add the *addLog* query to the modal and see it in action. Open the modal by clicking on *logTimeButton* and select the *submit* button that we've placed inside the modal. 

Under **Events** configuration of the *submit* button, click on **+ Add Handler**, leave the Event as **On Click**, select the Action as **Run Query** and select *addLog* as the query. 

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img style={{padding: '10px'}} className="screenshot-full" src="/img/quickstart-guide/modal-addlog-event.png" alt="Add addLog Query To Modal" />
</div>

Now whenever we click on the submit button, the *addLog* query will run and values present in the input fields will be written to the database.

We also need to show a prompt to indicate that the data has been added. Click on **+ Add Handler**, leave the Event as **On Click**, select the Action as **Show Alert** and enter **Log Added** as the Message and leave Alert Type as **Info**.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img style={{padding: '10px'}} className="screenshot-full" src="/img/quickstart-guide/alert-event.png" alt="Add Alert Event" />
</div>

Finally, we would want our modal to close once we click on **Submit** and the required query and alert is triggered. Add one more **Event**, select **Close Modal** as the action type and *logTimeModal* as **Modal**. 

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img style={{padding: '10px'}} className="screenshot-full" src="/img/quickstart-guide/close-modal-event.png" alt="Event to Close Modal" />
</div>

Now every time we click on the **Submit** button on the modal, the *addLog* query will run, followed by an alert and the modal being closed.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img style={{padding: '10px'}} className="screenshot-full" src="/img/quickstart-guide/add-log.gif" alt="Add New Log Entries" />
</div>

### Adding Actions To Tables

Let's create a way to delete entries from the **Table** component using **Actions**. 

We'll first create the required query to perform the action. Click on the **+ Add** button in the Query Panel. Select **ToolJet Database** from the list of available sources. Rename the query to *deleteLog*, select **Delete rows** as Operations. 

For the **Filter**, select **id** as the column(first field), **equals** as the operation(second field) and paste the below code in the **key** input(third field):
```js
{{components.trackerTable.selectedRow.id}}
```

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img style={{padding: '10px'}} className="screenshot-full" src="/img/quickstart-guide/delete-log-config.png" alt="Delete Log Entries" />
</div>

When you click on a table row, its values get stored under the selectedRow key. To remove that row from the database, we match **selectedRow.id** with the database's **id** field.

We also need to run the *getTrackerSummary* query once the *deleteLog* query is completed to ensure that the **Table** component gets reloaded with the updated data. Click on the **+ New Event Handler** button in the *deleteLog* query - a new event will be added. Click on the newly created event, leave Event as **Query Success**, select **Run Query** as Action and *getTrackerSummary* as Query.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img style={{padding: '10px'}} className="screenshot-full" src="/img/quickstart-guide/delete-query-success-event.png" alt="Delete Query Success Event" />
</div>


Now let's use this query with **Actions** in the **Table** component. 

Go to the **Action Buttons** section of the *trackerTable* properties. Click on **+ New action button** and change Button Text to **Delete**, Background color to **Red**(first color in the palette) and Text color to **White**(last color in the palette.)

Click on **+ New event handler** and leave the Event as **On click** and select **Run Query** as the Action. Select *deleteLog* for the Query dropdown. 

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img style={{padding: '10px'}} className="screenshot-full" src="/img/quickstart-guide/delete-action-config.png" alt="Delete Action Configuration" />
</div>

Now every time we click on the **Delete** action button, the *deleteLog* query will run and delete the related row. 

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img style={{padding: '10px'}} className="screenshot-full" src="/img/quickstart-guide/delete-log-demo.gif" alt="Delete Log Entries" />
</div>

### Filter Data Based On The Logged-In User

In a typical time-tracking application, we only need to show the data related to the logged-in user. To achieve that, we need to add a filter to our *getTrackerSummary* query. 

Open the *getTrackerSummary* query in the **Query Panel**, click on the **+ Add Condition** button associated with **Filter**.

For the **Filter**, select **employee** as the column(first field), **equals** as the operation(second field) and paste the below code in the **key** input(third field):
```js
{{globals.currentUser.email}}
```

Add some new entries to the Time Tracker. Earlier, we had put some test entries with test@gmail.com as the value for the **employee** column. Now, those entries will not appear and only the entries you have added with your current email(or logged in account) will appear on the table.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img style={{padding: '10px'}} className="screenshot-full" src="/img/quickstart-guide/logged-in-user-data.png" alt="Filtered Data For Logged-In User" />
</div>

Congratulations! You've successfully built a time tracker application and, in the process, covered the essential fundamentals of ToolJet. Now you're well-equipped to take on more complex projects. Happy building!
