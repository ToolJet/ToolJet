## What is ToolJet

ToolJet is an **open-source low-code framework** to build and deploy custom internal tools. 

ToolJet ships with its built-in database called **[ToolJet DB](/docs/tooljet-database)** (built on top of PostgreSQL). You can also connect to the **external data sources** such as **databases** ( PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MS SQL Server, Snowflake, , BigQuery, etc ), **API/GraphQL endpoints**, **SaaS tools** ( Airtable, Stripe, Google Sheets, etc ) and **cloud object storage services** ( AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage and Minio ). 

Once the data sources are connected, ToolJet can run **queries** on these data sources to fetch and update data. The data fetched from data sources can be **visualised and modified** using the UI widgets such as tables, charts, forms, etc. You can also use **[Javascript](/docs/data-sources/run-js)** or **[Python](/docs/data-sources/run-py)** queries for writing business logic or interacting with the user interface of the application.

<!-- Why ToolJet section is commented out.

## Why ToolJet

When you're building an internal tool, there are a lot of tools and frameworks available. But with ToolJet, you can save developers' hours by allowing them to build full-stack business applications in minutes.

- **Open-Source**: ToolJet is Open-Source, you can go through the ToolJet codebase on **[GitHub](https://github.com/ToolJet/ToolJet)** or you can **deploy ToolJet on your infrastructure**.
- **Full-stack platform**: ToolJet has a **[built-in database](/docs/tooljet-database)**, **[External datasources](/docs/data-sources/airtable)**, and a frontend builder so you can build a full-stack app right inside it. ToolJet comes with Custom Component for importing your own **react components** and the ability to write custom **JavaScript** and **Python** code.
- **Extensible**: Didn't find the **component** or **datasource** that fit your application's requirements? You can always build your own **component** and **datasource** using our **plugin development kit**.
- **Powerful Apps**: With ToolJet, developers can quickly build powerful custom internal tools for their Support, Operations and Sales teams. Build CRUD apps, Dashboards, Admin Panels, CRMs and much more.

## How ToolJet works

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

<img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/v2-beta/getting_started/howtjworks.webp" width="100%" height="100%" alt="How ToolJet works flow" />

</div>

**With ToolJet, you can build apps in 3 simple steps:**

1. **Connect to datasources:** Connect to the ToolJet's built-in database **[ToolJet DB](/docs/tooljet-database)** (built on top of PostgreSQL) or your existing data sources such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, Firestore, Stripe, Google Sheets, API endpoints, etc.

2. **Build queries:** ToolJet comes with query builders for all supported data sources. You can also write **[Javascript](/docs/data-sources/run-js)** or **[Python](/docs/data-sources/run-py)** queries or use **[Transformations](/docs/tutorial/transformations)** to transform the query response.

3. **Build User Interface:** ToolJet's visual **[App Builder](/docs/app-builder/overview)** allows you to drag and drop components ( Eg: tables, charts, forms, etc ) to quickly build the user-interface of the apps. Components have events such as `on click`, `on row selected`, `on page changed`, etc. ToolJet apps can be used in light and dark mode.

    :::tip
    ToolJet binds together the datasources, queries and components to convert business logic into custom applications. You can also secure your ToolJet apps with **[Group & Permissions](/docs/org-management/permissions)** and **[Audit Logging](/docs/Enterprise/audit_logs)**.
    :::
## Choose your ToolJet

There are a few different ways to set up ToolJet depending on how you intend to use it:

- **[ToolJet Cloud](https://www.tooljet.com)**: hosted solution, just sign-up for free and start building apps in seconds.
- **[Deploy on premise](/docs/setup/)**: recommended method for production or customized use cases. You'll find Server setup guides for popular platforms (AWS, GCP, Kubernetes etc) and one-click deployment guides (Heroku, DigitalOcean etc).
- **[Try ToolJet on local machine](/docs/setup/try-tooljet/)**: the fastest way to try out ToolJet on your computer using docker.

    <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/v2-beta/getting_started/quickstart/compressed/createnewtable.webp" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Getting started: Quickstart" />

    </div>

3. Once the table is created, click on the **Add new row** button to add the data to the table and click **Create**.
    <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

    <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/v2-beta/getting_started/quickstart/compressed/addnewrow.webp" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Getting started: Quickstart" />

    </div>

:::info
Learn more about the **[ToolJet Database here](/docs/tooljet-database)**
:::

### Create a new application

1. To create a new ToolJet application, go to the **Dashboard** -> **Create new application**. 

    <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

    <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/v2-beta/getting_started/quickstart/compressed/createnewapplication.webp" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Getting started: Quickstart" />

    </div>

    :::info
    You can also use the existing UI **templates** for your application or **import** an application to your workspace.
    :::

2. When you click on create new app the **App-builder** will open up. You can rename your application from `untitled` to **Support Tool** from the top left of app-builder.
    <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

    <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/v2-beta/getting_started/quickstart/compressed/appbuilder.webp" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Getting started: Quickstart" />

    </div>

### Build the UI

1. Let's build the UI of the application by dragging and dropping the components on the canvas.
2. To build the UI, we will use:
    1. **Table** for displaying the customers data 
    2. **Text** components for the Title and description of the app as the header
    3. **Text Input** component for getting product name input from the user
    4. **Number Input** component for getting product quantity and price input from the user
    5. **Button** component that will be used to trigger the query for inserting a row in the database using the button's **OnClick** event handler
    
    <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

    <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/v2-beta/getting_started/quickstart/compressed/buildingui.webp" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Getting started: Quickstart" />

    </div>

:::info
ToolJet application's User interface is constructed using Components like Tables, Forms, Charts, or Buttons etc. Check **[Components Catalog](/docs/widgets/overview)** to learn more.
:::

### Build queries and bind data to UI

1. We can add a new datasource from the **[Global datasources](/docs/data-sources/overview)** page from the dashboard but since we are using **ToolJet Database** we don't need to add any external datasource. Go to the **Query Panel and select ToolJet Database**
    <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

    <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/v2-beta/getting_started/quickstart/compressed/tooljetdb.webp" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Getting started: Quickstart" />

    </div>

    :::info
    ToolJet can connect to several databases, APIs and external services to fetch and modify data. Check **[Datasource Catalog](/docs/data-sources/overview)** to learn more.
    :::

2. Choose a **Table** from the dropdown, Select the **List rows** option from the **Operation** dropdown, You can leave other query parameters. Scroll down and enable **Run this query on application load** - this will trigger the query when the app is loaded. 

3. Click on **Create** to create the query and then click **Run** to trigger the query and get response. You can also check the query response by clicking **Preview** button without firing the query.
    <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

    <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/v2-beta/getting_started/quickstart/compressed/createquery.webp" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Getting started: Quickstart" />

    </div>

4. Go to the **Table properties** by clicking on the component handle and bind the data returned by the query in the **Table data** property. When building apps in ToolJet anything inside `{{}}` is JavaScript and we javascript dot notation to get the data from query and populate the table using **{{queries.tooljetdb1.data}}**. The table will be auto-populated once the table data is entered.
    <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

    <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/v2-beta/getting_started/quickstart/compressed/tabledata.webp" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Getting started: Quickstart" />

    </div>

5. Let's create another query that will get the data from the **input fields** and will add a new row in the tooljet database. **Create New Query** -> **Select Table (Customers)** -> **Select Operation (Create row)** -> add the following columns with the respective value:
    1. **id** - `{{components.textinput1.value}}`
    2. **quantity** - `{{components.numberinput1.value}}`
    3. **price** - `{{components.numberinput2.value}}`
    4. **created_at** - `{{moment().format("DD/MM/YYYY hh:mm A")}}` (We are using **momentjs library** to get the current date from the system rather than getting input by the user )

    <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

    <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/v2-beta/getting_started/quickstart/compressed/selecttablecustomers.webp" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Getting started: Quickstart" />

    </div>

    :::tip
    You can also add event handler to this query for **On Success** event to run the `tooljetdb1` query that populates the table, so that whenever this is successful the table is refreshed.
    :::

6. Now, let's bind this query to the **Add Product** button. Click on the button handle to open its properties, **Add an handler** -> **Select Event (On Click)** -> **Select Action (Run Query)** -> **Select Query (tooljetdb2)**. 
    <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

    <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/v2-beta/getting_started/quickstart/compressed/addproductbutton.webp" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Getting started: Quickstart" />

    </div>

:::info
- You can manipulate the data returned by the queries using **[Transformations](/docs/tutorial/transformations)**
- You can also **[Run JavaScript code](/docs/data-sources/run-js)** or **[Run Python code](/docs/data-sources/run-py)** to perform custom behavior inside ToolJet
:::

### Preview, Release and Share app

1. Click on the **Preview** on the top-right of app builder to immediately check the currently opened version of the app in production. 
2. Click on the  **Release** button to publish the currently opneded version of the app and push the changes to production.
3. **Share** option allows you to share the **released version** of the application with other users or you can also make the app **public** and anyone with the URL will be able to use the app.

:::tip
You can control how much access to users have to your ToolJet apps and resources using **[Org Management](/docs/tutorial/manage-users-groups)**.
