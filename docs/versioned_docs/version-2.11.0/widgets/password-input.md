# Password Input

A Password Input widget provides a way for the users to securely enter a password. The Password Input is a one-line plain text editor in which the text is obscured so that it cannot be read, by replacing each character with an asterisk ("*") symbol.

## General
### Tooltip

A Tooltip is often used to specify extra information about something when the user hovers the mouse pointer over the widget.

Under the <b>General</b> accordion, you can set the value in the string format. Now hovering over the widget will display the string as the tooltip.
