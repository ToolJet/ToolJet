# Tracking    

:::tip
ToolJet does not store any data fetched from the data sources. ToolJet acts as a proxy and the data from data sources is sent to the client application without storing.
:::

## Server

:::tip
Self-hosted version of ToolJet pings our server to fetch the latest product updates every 24 hours. You can disable this by setting the value of `CHECK_FOR_UPDATES` environment variable to `false`. This feature is enabled by default.
:::

## Client 

ToolJet tracks anonymous usage data such as page loads and clicks. ToolJet tracks only the events and doesn't capture data from data sources.

Tracking can be disabled by setting the value environment variable `ENABLE_TRACKING` to `0`.
