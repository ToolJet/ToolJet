The White Label feature allows you to completely remove ToolJet's branding from the ToolJet platform, allowing you to replace it with your own customized logo, favicon and page title. This feature grants you full control over the visual identity of your ToolJet-powered application, ensuring a seamless and personalized user experience.

With this feature, you gain the ability to rebrand the following key elements:

- **Application Logo**: This includes the logo displayed on the login screen, dashboard, and app-editor.

</div>

- **Favicon**: The small icon associated with your application.

</div>

- **Page Title**: This is the text displayed next to the Favicon.
