# Google Sheets

ToolJet can connect to Google Sheet using OAuth 2.0, which helps us to limit an application's access to a user's account.

## How to integrate Google Sheets

<iframe height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3PO41waW2CQ" title="ToolJet Googlsheet Integration" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen width="100%"></iframe>

## Self-Hosted Configuration

If you are self-hosting the application, you will need to perform some additional steps.

  1. Follow the [Google OAuth 2.0 setup steps outlined here](/docs/setup/env-vars#google-oauth--optional-)
  2. Set the following environment variables with the values from the previous step:
     * `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
     * `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
     * `TOOLJET_HOST`
  3. Enable the Google Sheets API in the GCP console

## Authorization Scopes 

You can create a Google Sheets data source with one of either of the two permission scopes :
  1. **Read Only**
  2. **Read and Write**
