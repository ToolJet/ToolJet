## Properties

### Default value

This value acts as placeholder for the date picker widget, if any value is not provided then the default value will be used from the picker. The default value needs to be a `String` with respect to the `format` field. Ex: If format is set to `MM/YYYY` then provide default value as `04/2022`.

### Format

The format of the date selected by the date picker. Default date format is **DD/MM/YYYY**. Date format should be followed as ISO 8601 as mentioned in the [moment documentation](https://momentjs.com/docs/). This field requires a `String` input. Ex: `DD/MM`, `MM/YYYY`, `YY/MM`, `DD/MM/YYYY` etc.

### Enable time selection?

Toggle on or off to enable the time selection. You can programmatically determine the value by clicking on `Fx` to set the value `{{true}}` or `{{false}}`.

### Enable date selection?

Toggle on or off to enable the date selection. You can programmatically determine the value by clicking on `Fx` to set the value `{{true}}` or `{{false}}`.

### Disabled dates

We can give disabled dates property which will make specific dates disabled and cannot be selected. The default value needs to be an array of`Strings`.

Example for disabling the 9th of January:
```js
{{['09-01']}}
```

Now user won't be able to select the mentioned date since it will be disabled. 

## Validation

### Custom Validation

Add a validation for the date input in the widget using the ternary operator.

Example of validation for selecting dates that are after the current date:
```js
{{moment(components.datepicker1.value, 'DD/MM/YYYY').isAfter(moment()) ? true : 'Date should be after today'}}
```
### General
#### Tooltip

A Tooltip is often used to specify extra information about something when the user hovers the mouse pointer over the widget.

Under the <b>General</b> accordion, you can set the value in the string format. Now hovering over the widget will display the string as the tooltip.

Toggle on or off to display the widget in desktop view. You can programmatically determine the value by clicking on `Fx` to set the value `{{true}}` or `{{false}}`.
### Show on mobile

## Styles

### Visibility

This is to control the visibility of the widget. If `{{false}}` the widget will not visible after the app is deployed. It can only have boolean values i.e. either `{{true}}` or `{{false}}`. By default, it's set to `{{true}}`.

### Disable

This property only accepts boolean values. If set to `{{true}}`, the widget will be locked and becomes non-functional. By default, its value is set to `{{false}}`.

### Border Radius

Use this property to modify the border radius of the date-picker. The field expects only numerical value from `1` to `100`, default is `0`. 

:::info
Any property having `Fx` button next to its field can be **programmatically configured**.
