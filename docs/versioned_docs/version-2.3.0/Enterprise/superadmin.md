## Super Admin features

### Access any workspace

If a user is a Super Admin then they can switch to any workspace created by any user in the instance from the dropdown on the top-left of dashboard that is used to switch between workspaces.

The dropdown will list all the workspaces including workspaces created by the Super Admin or Any User.

### Create Edit or Delete apps from any user's personal workspace

Once the Super Admin accesses the workspace of any other user, they can create, edit or delete app on the workspace.

This also includes - modifying folders and importing, exporting, or cloning apps to any user's workspace.

### Archive/Unarchive Users

Super Admin can not only archive/unarchive users/admins on their workspace but also from the workspaces of any other user.

If a user is Super Admin, they just need to open the workspace in which they want to archive or unarchive a user. Then go to the **Workspace Settings** from the sidebar -> **Manage Users** -> **Archive/Unarchive** any user/admin

### Restrict creation of personal workspace of users

When a user joins a workspace, they are provided with their own personal workspace and option to create new workspaces.

Super Admins can **control** this behavior from the Manage Instance Settings page, they can **toggle off** the option to **Allow personal workspace**. Now whenever a user joins a workspace they won't be provided a personal workspace nor they will be able to create a new workspace in the instance.
