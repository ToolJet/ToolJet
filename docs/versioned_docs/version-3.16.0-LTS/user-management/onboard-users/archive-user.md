title: Archive and Unarchive

Admins can archive users in a workspace which will remove the access to the workspace for the user but will preserve all the apps and changes done by the user and the user can be re-invited to the workspace by unarchiving the user if needed.

:::info
1. Archived users will not be counted for billing/licensing.
2. There must be at least one active admin; all the admins in a workspace cannot be archived.
