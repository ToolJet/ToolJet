OneLogin can be configured as the Identity Provider for OIDC, which is an authentication protocol that securely verifies user identities through a trusted provider. This document explains how to obtain the required credentials from the OneLogin Console. Refer to the **[OIDC Setup](/docs/user-management/sso/oidc/setup)** guide to configure OIDC in your application.
