## What is ToolJet?

ToolJet is an AI-native platform for building applications and agents. Teams can generate full apps from natural language prompts, create intelligent agents to automate workflows, and refine them visually with pre-built UI components. ToolJet integrates with 75+ data sources and APIs out of the box, and offers role-based access control with group sync for secure, enterprise-grade user management.

**With ToolJet, you can streamline app development with 5 core steps:** <br/>

1. **Generate with AI**: Instantly create and modify apps, queries, and workflows from prompts.

2. **Build Visually**: Extend apps with drag-and-drop components, themes, and custom logic in JavaScript or Python.

3. **Connect Data Sources**: Integrate 75+ databases, APIs, and services.

4. **Automate with Agents**: Deploy AI agents that can query data, take actions, and orchestrate workflows.

5. **Secure and Manage**: Secure your internal tools with detailed permissions settings and audit logs. Maintain quality and consistency with version control, and keep track of performance with comprehensive observability tools.

Below is a detailed overview of ToolJet's key functionalities, demonstrating how ToolJet helps teams to build more with less effort and greater efficiency. 

### AI App Builder  
Generate applications directly from natural language prompts. AI handles the initial structure, UI, and queries so teams can go from idea to a working prototype in seconds.
