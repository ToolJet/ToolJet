title: Data Source Node
---

<br/>

The **Data Source** node allows you to connect your workflow to external data sources, such as databases, APIs, or third-party services. With the **Data Source** node, you can:

- Retrieve data from databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB
- Fetch information from REST or GraphQL APIs
- Integrate with SaaS platforms such as ClickUp, Salesforce, or Slack
- Integrate AI APIs such OpenAI or Anthropic
- Perform queries, filters, or transformations before passing data to other nodes

The **Data Source** node is essential for building dynamic workflows that depend on real-time data. It enables enterprise-level automation, reporting, and decision-making by seamlessly bringing external data into your workflow.

Each **Data Source** node has specific configurations based on its type:
- **PostgreSQL**: SQL query fields
- **REST API**: HTTP method, endpoint, headers
- **Twilio**: SMS configuration fields
- And more based on your configured sources
