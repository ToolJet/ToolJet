You can perform the following operation on the workflow nodes:

### Error Handling

The **Error Handling** node operation in ToolJet workflows lets you define different execution paths based on whether a node succeeds or fails. If a node runs successfully, the workflow continues along the success path, if it fails, the error path is triggered, allowing you to perform custom actions like logging, notifications, or retries.

### Copy

The **Copy** operation lets you copy a node’s configuration to your clipboard. You can then paste it into another part of the workflow or a different workflow for quick reuse.

### Duplicate

The **Duplicate** operation instantly creates a copy of the node in the same workflow. This helps speed up building workflows with similar nodes without reconfiguring from scratch.

### Delete

The **Delete** operation removes a node and its connections from the workflow. Use this to clean up unused or obsolete nodes and keep your workflow organized.
