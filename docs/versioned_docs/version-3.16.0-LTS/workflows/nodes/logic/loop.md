title: Loop Node
---

<br/>

The **Loop** node allows you to iterate over an array of items and perform actions on each item within your workflow. It is useful when you need to process multiple records, send bulk notifications, or execute repetitive tasks dynamically.

With the Loop node, you can:
- Iterate through arrays returned from APIs or database queries
- Perform actions on each item individually (e.g., send emails, create tasks)
- Combine with other nodes to aggregate results or handle errors per item
- Automate bulk operations efficiently without manual intervention
