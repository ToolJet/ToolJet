| End User     |      50       | All users beyond 50 will be archived automatically.                                                                                                           |

### Unarchiving Desired Users Affected Due to New Pricing Plan

If a user is automatically archived due to the new pricing plan, the Super Admin can [archive](/docs/user-management/onboard-users/archive-user#instance-level) an active Builder or End User to free up a slot and then [unarchive](/docs/user-management/onboard-users/archive-user#instance-level-1) the desired user.
