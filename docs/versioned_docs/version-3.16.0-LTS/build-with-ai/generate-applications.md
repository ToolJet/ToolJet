This guide explains how to quickly generate and modify business applications using ToolJet. You can create an app from scratch with a single prompt or enhance an existing app with AI-powered assistance.

## Creating Application
To create an application, follow these steps:

1. **Enter a prompt** – Describe the business application you want to build in the prompt input on the dashboard.
    <img className="screenshot-full img-full" style={{ marginTop: '15px' }} src="/img/tooljet-ai/generate01.png" alt="tooljet generate apps " />
2. **Accept or modify requirements** – After submitting your prompt, the app will be created, and you’ll be taken to the App Builder, where a list of features, a database schema, design details, and query specifications will be generated based on your prompt. 
    <img className="screenshot-full img-full" style={{ marginTop: '15px' }} src="/img/tooljet-ai/generate02.png" alt="tooljet generate apps " />
    You can accept or modify these application requirements after reviewing them thoroughly.
    <img className="screenshot-full img-full" style={{ marginTop: '15px' }} src="/img/tooljet-ai/generate03.png" alt="tooljet generate apps " />
3. **App Generation** – Once you confirm the requirements, ToolJet will build the application inside the App Builder.
    <img className="screenshot-full img-full" style={{ marginTop: '15px' }} src="/img/tooljet-ai/generate04.png" alt="tooljet generate apps " />

## Modifying Application

You can modify any application in ToolJet with AI assistance, whether it's a newly created app or an existing one. You can update components and queries within your application with just a prompt. 

For example, if you want to add a button in your app you can write a prompt for the same.
<img className="screenshot-full img-full" src="/img/tooljet-ai/generate05.png" alt="tooljet generate apps " />

## Limitations
