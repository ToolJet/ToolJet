### 1. Data Sharing Commitments

Your sensitive business data, customer information, and proprietary datasets remain protected and under your control.

**Credential Security**: We do not share any data source credentials (such as database passwords or API keys) with our AI servers or third-party LLM providers. If you are self-hosting, these credentials never leave your deployment. If you are using ToolJet Cloud, this data never leaves our secure servers.

We utilize multiple AI models from Anthropic and OpenAI to power our generation features.

When you explicitly use our schema-aware AI features, we share your prompts, application metadata (such as UI components), database schemas (e.g., table and column names), and strictly limited sample data necessary for the AI to understand your data structure.

This data is transmitted securely and exclusively for the purpose of fulfilling your immediate application generation request. It is not shared outside your deployment for any other reason.

### 2. Deployment Options
You can meet your organization's specific security, compliance, and data residency requirements while maintaining control over your infrastructure with our self-hosted deployment option.

While we currently utilize cloud-based LLMs (such as Anthropic and OpenAI) for AI features, these integrations can be managed or disabled by workspace administrators.

If you require a strictly air-gapped environment, you can set up a separate instance of ToolJet for development, or choose to disable the AI schema-reading capabilities to ensure no structural or sample data leaves your internal network.

Self-hosted enterprise plan of ToolJet has an option to deploy our AI gateway on-premise with your own LLM keys. Reach out to hello@tooljet.com for details.

### 3. Data Usage Policies
Your proprietary information, business processes, and competitive advantages remain exclusively yours.

**Data Transmission and Processing**: To optimize performance, maintain context during your app generation session, and help the AI understand your data structure, limited sample data from your connected databases may be securely transmitted to and processed by AI servers hosted by ToolJet. This data remains protected by strict access controls and security protocols.

Zero Training Policy: We do not use any user data, database schemas, or sample data to train, fine-tune, or improve our AI models, nor do we allow our third-party LLM providers to do so. Your data is strictly used to facilitate the operation of the ToolJet platform.
