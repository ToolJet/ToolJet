title: Understanding AI Credits
---

The ToolJet AI credits are consumed on every AI operation performed in ToolJet. With these credits, you can carry out tasks such as [generating application](#), [using AI Docs Assistant](#), modifying UI and queries, write custom code, and more. In this guide you will learn types of credits, credit usage, getting more credits, etc.

## Types of Credits

### Monthly Credits

Monthly credits are recurring credits included with your purchased license. They renew every month on the billing cycle date and are valid for one month. Any unused credits will not carry forward to the next month. Even if you are on an annual plan, credits are still renewed on a monthly basis.

### Add-on Credits

Add-on credits can be purchased in addition to your monthly credits and are a one-time purchase that do not renew monthly. These credits can only be purchased in multiples of 100 and are valid for one year from the date of purchase. If you buy additional credits after an initial purchase, the validity of the entire pool of credits is extended based on the latest purchase date.

## Credit Allocation

ToolJet AI credits are allocated on a per builder per month basis according to the purchased license. The total credits from all builders, along with any add-on credits purchased, are pooled together and made available collectively.
- At **Instance Level** for [Self-Hosted](#) deployments.
- At **Workspace Level** for [Cloud](#) deployments.

## Credit Usage

Credit usage in ToolJet follows a pay-as-you-go model, where the number of credits consumed depends on the complexity of the request. Monthly credits are always consumed first. Add-on credits are utilized only after the monthly credits are exhausted. The table below provides an average range of credits utilized for different operations to help you estimate usage.

| Operation | Avg. Credits Utilised |
|:----------|:---------------------:|
| App Generation | 100 |
| Adding New Feature in the Application | 100 |
| Modifying Layout/UI | 50 |
| Modifying Queries/Database | 30 |
| Debug Components Auto Fix | 10 |
| AI Docs Assistant | 6 |
| SQL Query Generation | 5 |
| Custom Code Generation | 2 |

:::warning
These values are only average estimates to help plan your operations. **Actual credit consumption will vary depending on the complexity of the operation**.
