title: Understanding AI Credits
---

:::warning
This implementation of AI credits will be available from 22nd September 2025.
:::

A credit is a standardized unit of AI processing power consumed on every AI operation performed in ToolJet. Each operation, from [generating complete applications](/docs/build-with-ai/generate-applications) to creating custom code or modifying layouts, consumes a varied amount of credits based on the complexity and type of task. This approach provides transparent cost visibility while enabling you to scale your AI usage on-demand. 

In this guide you will learn about types of credits, credit usage, getting more credits, and more.

## Credit Usage

Credit usage in ToolJet varies based on the complexity of the request. Monthly credits are always consumed first. Add-on credits are utilized only after the monthly credits are exhausted. The table below provides an average range of credits utilized for different operations to help you estimate usage.

| Operation | Avg. Credits Utilised |
|:----------|:---------------------:|
| [App Generation](/docs/build-with-ai/generate-applications) | 100 |
| Adding New Feature in the Application | 100 |
| Modifying Layout/UI | 50 |
| Modifying Queries/Database | 30 |
| [Debug Components Auto Fix](/docs/build-with-ai/debug-components) | 10 |
| [AI Docs Assistant](/docs/build-with-ai/ai-docs-assistant) | 6 |
| SQL Query Generation | 5 |
| Custom Code Generation | 2 |

:::warning
These values are only average estimates to help plan your operations. **Actual credit consumption will vary depending on the complexity of the operation**.

## Types of Credits

### Monthly Credits

Monthly credits are recurring credits included with your purchased license. They renew every month on the billing cycle date and are valid for one month. Any unused credits will not carry forward to the next month. Even if you are on an annual plan, credits are still renewed on a monthly basis.

### Add-on Credits

Add-on credits can be purchased in addition to your monthly credits and are a one-time purchase that do not renew monthly. These credits can only be purchased in multiples of 100 and are valid for one year from the date of purchase. If you buy additional credits after an initial purchase, the validity of the entire pool of credits is extended based on the latest purchase date. Checkout the [pricing](https://www.tooljet.ai/pricing) page for more information.

- At **Instance Level** for [Self-Hosted](/docs/tj-setup/tj-deployment#self-hosted-tooljet) deployments.
- At **Workspace Level** for [Cloud](/docs/tj-setup/tj-deployment#tooljet-cloud) deployments.
