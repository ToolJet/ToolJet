**Modules** in ToolJet are reusable user interfaces that bundle components, queries, actions, and logic. Think of them as mini-apps you can plug into multiple applications within the same workspace. They help eliminate duplication, ensure consistency, and speed up development—especially for repeatable patterns like headers, forms, dashboards, or table views.

Once created, modules can be reused across your workspace. Any updates you make to a module automatically reflect in every app where it's used. This ensures a single source of truth and significantly reduces maintenance effort.

## When to Use Modules

Use modules when:

- You need a shared UI element, like a customer profile or navigation bar, across multiple apps.
- You’re building repeatable flows such as approval forms, data filters, or input panels.
- You want to simplify complex logic so others can use it with minimal setup.

Instead of copy-pasting components or logic across apps, modules give you a centralized, reusable way to build features, fully configurable through inputs and outputs to fit any context.

To get started with modules, check out the [Create Module](/docs/beta/app-builder/modules/create-module) guide. Once your module is built, you can [use it inside any app](/docs/beta/app-builder/modules/use-module) in your workspace.
