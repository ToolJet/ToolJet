### Data format for CSV

For `CSV` file type, the data field should be supplied with an array objects. ToolJet assumes that the keys of each of
these objects are the same and that they represent the column headers of the csv file.

Example:

```javascript
{{
  [
    { name: 'John', email: 'john@tooljet.com' },
    { name: 'Sarah', email: 'sarah@tooljet.com' },
  ]
}}
```

Supplying the above snippet will generate a csv file which looks like this:

```csv
name,email
John,john@tooljet.com
Sarah,sarah@tooljet.com
```
