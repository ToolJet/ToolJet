Whether itâ€™s transforming data, manipulating component properties, or performing actions based on certain conditions, Run JavaScript code significantly enhances the capabilities of your ToolJet applications.

## Interacting with Components and Actions
The JavaScript code you write can interact with various components of the ToolJet application. For example, you could attach an event handler to a button so that when it's clicked, it triggers Run Javascript code to run. Additionally, you can construct the JavaScript code to manipulate the properties of other components. This allows for dynamic interactions within your application.
