### Redis setup

:::info
ToolJet requires configuring Redis which is used for enabling multiplayer editing and for background jobs.
:::

Follow the steps below to configure Redis database:

1. Navigate to **Database** and create a database cluster.

  </div>

2. Select `Redis` from the database engine and add a unique name to the cluster and click on **Create Database cluster**.

  </div>

3. Once the set-up is complete, add the Redis connection string in the environmental variable of `tooliet-app`.

  </div>

3. Now, on **Environment Variables** page you can add new variables or edit the existing ones. Check the [environment variables here](/docs/setup/env-vars).

  Also, please add the redis url in the environment variable `REDIS_URL= #connection string`

  <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

  <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/setup/digitalocean/env.png" alt="ToolJet - Deploy on DigitalOcean - Environment Variables" />

  </div>

4. On the next page, you can change the **App name**, **Project**, and the **Region**.

  <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

  <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/setup/digitalocean/region.png" alt="ToolJet - Deploy on DigitalOcean - Launch" />

  </div>

5. On the last page, you'll be asked to **Review** all the app details such that we entered before such as **Resources**, **Environment Variables**, **Region**, and there will also be **Billing** section at the end. Review all the details and click the **Create Resource** button.

  </div>

6. Once you click the **Create Resource** button, the build will begin. Once the build is complete, you'll see the resource and a **URL** next to it. Click on the URL to open the deployed **ToolJet**.

:::tip
ToolJet server and client can be deployed as standalone applications. If you do not want to deploy the client on DigitalOcean, modify `package.json` accordingly. We have a [guide](/docs/setup/client) on deploying ToolJet client using services such as Firebase.

## Deploying Tooljet Database

If you intend to use this feature, you'd have to set up and deploy PostgREST server which helps querying ToolJet Database.
You can learn more about this feature [here](/docs/tooljet-database).

Follow the steps below to deploy ToolJet Database on DigitalOcean:

1. If you are using dev database within ToolJet deployment, upgrade it to managed database. You could also add a separate database, if you intent use a different database, please refer the [environment variables](/docs/setup/env-vars#enable-tooljet-database--optional-) for additional env variables. 

2. Create a new app for PostgREST server. You can opt for docker hub to deploy PostgREST image of version `10.1.x`.

  <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/setup/digitalocean/postgrest-build.png" alt="ToolJet - Deploy on DigitalOcean - PostgREST resource" />

3. Update the [environment variables](/docs/setup/env-vars#postgrest-server-optional) for PostgREST and expose the HTTP port `3000`.

  <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/setup/digitalocean/postgrest-env.png" alt="ToolJet - Deploy on DigitalOcean - PostgREST environment variables" />

4. Add your newly created PostgREST app to the trusted sources of your managed or separate database.

5. Update your existing ToolJet application deployment with [environment variables](/docs/setup/env-vars#enable-tooljet-database--optional-) required for PostgREST. 

## Upgrading to v2.24.3-ee2.10.2

Version v2.24.3-ee2.10.2 includes architectural changes and, hence, comes with new migrations.

If this is a new installation of the application, you may start directly with version v2.24.3-ee2.10.2. This guide is not required for new installations.

#### Prerequisites for Upgrading to the Latest Version:

- It is **crucial to perform a comprehensive backup of your database** before starting the upgrade process to prevent data loss.

- Ensure that your current version is v2.23.3-ee2.10.2 before upgrading. 

- Users on versions earlier than v2.23.3-ee2.10.2 must first upgrade to this version before proceeding to v2.24.3-ee2.10.2.

For specific issues or questions, refer to our **[Slack](https://tooljet.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-25438diev-mJ6LIZpJevG0LXCEcL0NhQ#)**.
