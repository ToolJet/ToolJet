## Retry limits

The user password authentication method will be disabled after predefined numbers of wrong password attempts. This feature can be disabled using setting `DISABLE_PASSWORD_RETRY_LIMIT` to `true` in environment variables. Number of retries allowed will be 5 by default, it can be override by `PASSWORD_RETRY_LIMIT` environment variable.
