The ToolJet Dashboard is the initial landing page that you see upon logging into your workspace. This interface serves as a central hub where you can access a variety of features. Primarily, it displays all the applications you've created within ToolJet. Moreover, you have the capability to create new workspaces and applications directly from this dashboard. Additionally, it provides an option to create folders for categorizing and managing applications for easier organization, access control, and workflow management.

Furthermore, the dashboard serves as a gateway to various essential sections, such as **[Workflows](/docs/workflows/overview)**, **[ToolJet Database](/docs/tooljet-database)**, **[Data Sources](/docs/data-sources/overview)**, **[Marketplace](/docs/marketplace/marketplace-overview)**, **[Workspace Settings](/docs/tutorial/manage-users-groups)**, **[Instance Settings](/docs/enterprise/superadmin/#instance-settings)**, and **[Audit logs](/docs/enterprise/audit_logs/)**. You can effortlessly navigate to these sections directly from the dashboard.

### Importing app connected to marketplace plugins

When importing an app with marketplace plugins, the marketplace plugin should be installed in the tooljet workspace where the app is being imported. If the marketplace plugin is not installed, the app will be imported without the queries for that plugin.

#### When marketplace plugin is not installed

If you have an app with a query linked to a marketplace plugin, and you import that app in a tooljet workspace where the marketplace plugin is not installed as the data source, the queries will be not be available in the imported application.

### Importing app connected to tooljet table

When the app(JSON file) that includes the table schema is imported, and the table is not present in the tooljet database of the workspace where the app is being imported, a new table will be created in the tooljet database with the same name as the table in the imported app. 

If the table with the same name is already present in the workspace, the new table will be created with the name `<table name>_<unix timestamp>`. Example: `<tablename>_1627980000`.
