## Setting up for Licensing

This comprehensive guide aims to assist you in the process of configuring paid plans on your self-hosted platform. We offer three different licenses tailored to your specific requirements. Let's explore how to get the most out of ToolJet's powerful features! 🚀

Let's look into three types of licenses:

1. **Trial License**: This is a free license that grants access to premium features for a 14-day trial period.
 - **New Users**: Choose the 14-day trial during onboarding.
 - **Existing Users**: Request a trial license key from our sales or support team.
2. **Business License**: This is a paid license that you can purchase **[directly](https://www.tooljet.com/pricing)**.
3. **Enterprise License**: This is a paid license with customizable options. To obtain this license, you have to contact our sales team.

## Updating Your Trial License Key (For Existing Users)

If you are an existing user and wish to update your trial license key, follow these steps:

1. Set up the instance and log in as a **[Super Admin](/docs/Enterprise/superadmin)**.
2. Navigate to the Settings page.
3. In the license key tab, make the necessary updates to the provided license key.
4. Within the license tab of the Settings page, you can access the limit tab, which displays the current status of available super admins, builders, and end users.

:::caution Note 
The trial license key will be valid for 14 days. To fully enjoy ToolJet, we recommend upgrading to premium plans within this period. If you wish to upgrade from the trial to the business or enterprise edition, you can click the **Upgrade or Renew** button or contact our team via **[Slack](https://tooljet.com/slack)**. Upon expiration, access to premium features like OpenID SSO login and Audit logs will be restricted, ensuring no data loss occurs. However, don't worry! You can still upgrade to any of our premium plans and enjoy the benefits of ToolJet.
