ToolJet employs a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system to manage security and access to its resources, which include apps, folders, and workspace variables. In this system, Admins have the authority to invite Users to their workspaces and assign them to specific Groups. Each Group is associated with a set of Permissions that dictate what level of access its members have to various resources.

## Groups and User Roles

ToolJet provides a set of default user roles (e.g., Admin, Builder, End-user) and the ability to create custom groups (e.g., Support, Engineering, Finance) for more granular access control. These groups and roles determine the level of access a user has to resources within the workspace.

## Setting Permissions Based on Groups and Permissions
To secure your applications in ToolJet, you can leverage Groups and Permissions. For instance, you could create a custom group named Finance Team and assign it permissions to only access financial apps and constants within the workspace. When you invite new users, you can directly assign them to this group, ensuring they only have access to the resources they need to perform their tasks. You can also make the app public and make it accessible to users without the need to log in.
