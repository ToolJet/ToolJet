The Topbar of the app-builder interface serves as a central hub for configuring app settings.

### Application Name

To modify the app name, click on the application name on the left side of the topbar.

Toggle between Mobile and Desktop views directly from the topbar to switch the canvas mode.

</div>

#### Showing Components on Mobile or Desktop layout

Select a component and navigate to its Properties Panel on the right. Scroll down to the **Devices** section and toggle on the `Show on mobile` option. This will ensure that the component is visible in Mobile view.

</div>

Similarly, you can toggle on the `Show on desktop` option to make the component visible in the Desktop view.

### Changes Saved Indicator

Whenever changes are made in the application, they are saved automatically. The topbar's `Changes Saved` indicator shows the save status.

### Developer Details

The Developer Details icon will show a profile picture of the currently active developer. Hovering over this picture reveals the developer's name. If no picture is set, initials are displayed.

### Preview

The Preview button allows you to view the current app version in a new tab, facilitating immediate feedback on changes.

</div>

### Release

Use the Release button on the right to publish the current app version. The Release button, used to publish the current app version, becomes visible only in the Production environment, ensuring that only finalized versions are made public.

:::caution
ToolJet will block editing of the Released version of an app and will display a prompt to create a new version to make the changes. This is to prevent accidentally pushing an unfinished app to the live version.
