ToolJet provides a variety of configuration options to help your organization tailor the platform to your specific needs. This section outlines key setup areas for your organization, including branding, subscription plans, deployment options, and workspace management, to ensure an optimized experience for your team.

## Deployment Options and Subscription Plans

ToolJet provides two deployment options — **Self-Hosted** and **Cloud** — enabling users to select the model that best suits their requirements. In addition to deployment options, ToolJet provides a range of subscription plans for each deployment model, offering various features and benefits. Refer to the **[Choose Your ToolJet](/docs/tj-setup/tj-deployment)** guide for further details.

## Instances and Workspaces

In ToolJet, a self-hosted deployment of the platform is referred to as an **[instance](/docs/tj-setup/instances)**. Each instance operates independently, maintaining its own configuration, data, and user base. Within each instance, **[workspaces](/docs/tj-setup/workspaces)** provide isolated spaces for different teams or projects, enabling users to manage apps, resources, and access controls effectively. 

## Organization Branding

ToolJet offers customization through **[white labeling](/docs/tj-setup/org-branding/white-labeling)** and **[custom domain](/docs/tj-setup/org-branding/custom-domain)** setup, allowing you to tailor your instance to align with your brand guidelines. White labeling ensures the platform reflects your organization’s brand identity, while a custom domain allows you to use your own web address for the ToolJet instance.

## SMTP Server

Additionally, ToolJet enables you to **[set up your email communication server](/docs/tj-setup/smtp-setup/configuration)** to manage tasks such as sending invitations and password reset requests, facilitating seamless communication within your team and with external stakeholders.
