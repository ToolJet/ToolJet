## Cloud vs Self-Hosted Deployment

### ToolJet Cloud

ToolJet Cloud is a managed service hosted by the ToolJet team. It eliminates the need for infrastructure management, providing a quick setup and seamless updates. This option is ideal for teams looking for convenience and minimal operational overhead.

#### Why to use ToolJet Cloud?

1. **Hassle-Free Setup**: With ToolJet Cloud, there’s no need to manage servers or infrastructure. Everything is set up and maintained by the ToolJet team, allowing you to focus solely on building applications.
2. **Seamless Updates and Maintenance**: ToolJet Cloud ensures you always have access to the latest features and updates without manual intervention. Maintenance, backups, and uptime are handled for you.
3. **Scalability**: The cloud deployment is designed to scale automatically as your team or application requirements grow, ensuring consistent performance.

### Self-Hosted ToolJet

With the self-hosted option, ToolJet can be deployed on your own infrastructure (on-premises or cloud). This provides more control over data, customization, and integrations, making it a preferred choice for organizations with stringent compliance or privacy requirements.

#### Why to use Self-Hosted ToolJet?

1. **Complete Data Control**: Deploying ToolJet on your infrastructure ensures your data stays within your control, meeting stringent compliance and privacy requirements.
2. **Customizability**: Self-hosted deployments allow for deeper customization to align with your organization's workflows, integrations, and unique needs.
3. **Enhanced Security**: By hosting ToolJet on-premises or in your private cloud, you can implement your own security measures, providing an added layer of protection for sensitive data.
