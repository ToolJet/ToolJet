## Adding Users

### Business Plan

Your business plan subscription cost is based on the total number of builder and viewer seats allocated to your account. You may choose between annual or monthly billing cycles.

**Seat Pricing**

| <div style={{ width:"100px"}}> Seat Type </div> | <div style={{ width:"135px"}}> Annual Billing </div> | <div style={{width: "200px"}}> Monthly Billing </div>|
| :------------ | :---------- | :------------ |
| Builder     | $24 per month    | $30 per month |
| End User        | $8 per month      | $10 per month |

**Pro-rated charges for added seats**

You only pay for the portion of the service you actually utilize, rather than being charged a full amount for a seat you might only use for a few days. If you add extra builder or viewer seats mid-cycle, charges are calculated proportionally. The cost is adjusted for the remaining days within your current billing period (monthly or annual).

Example: If you add a builder seat halfway through your monthly billing cycle, you will be charged $15 for the remaining portion of that month. Starting with your next billing cycle, you will be charged the full monthly rate ($30) for the added builder seat.
