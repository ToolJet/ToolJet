This guide explains how to quickly generate and modify business applications using ToolJet. You can create an app from scratch with a single prompt or enhance an existing app with AI-powered assistance.

## Creating Application
To create an application, follow these steps:

1. **Enter a prompt** – Describe the business application you want to build in the prompt input on the dashboard.

2. **Accept or modify requriements** – After submitting your prompt, the app will be created, and you’ll be taken to the App Builder, where a list of features, a database schema, design details, and query specifications will be generated based on your prompt. You can accept or modify these application requirements after reviewing them thoroughly.

3. **App Generation** – Once you confirm the requirements, ToolJet will build the application inside the App Builder.

## Modifying Application

You can modify any application in ToolJet with AI assitance, whether it's a newly created app or an existing one. You can update components and queries within your application with just a prompt.

## Limitations
ToolJet AI supports generating queries for the following data sources:
- [Postgres](/docs/data-sources/postgresql/)
- [MySQL](/docs/data-sources/mysql/)
- [SQL Server](/docs/data-sources/mssql/)
