# Deploying ToolJet on Kubernetes (GKE)

:::info
You should setup a PostgreSQL database manually to be used by ToolJet. We recommend using Cloud SQL since this guide is for deploying using GKE.
:::

Follow the steps below to deploy ToolJet on a GKE Kubernetes cluster.

1. Create an SSL certificate.

```bash
curl -LO https://tooljet-deployments.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/kubernetes/GKE/certificate.yaml
```

Change the domain name to the domain/subdomain that you wish to use for ToolJet installation.

2. Reserve a static IP address using `gcloud` cli

```bash
gcloud compute addresses create tj-static-ip --global
```

3. Create k8s deployment

```bash
curl -LO https://tooljet-deployments.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/kubernetes/GKE/deployment.yaml
```

Make sure to edit the environment variables in the `deployment.yaml`. You can check out the available options [here](/docs/setup/env-vars).

:::info
        For the setup, ToolJet requires:
        <ul>
        - **PG_HOST**
        - **PG_DB**
        - **PG_USER**
        - **PG_PASS**
        - **SECRET_KEY_BASE** 
        - **LOCKBOX_KEY**
        </ul>
        Read **[environment variables reference](/docs/setup/env-vars)**
:::

:::info
If there are self signed HTTPS endpoints that Tooljet needs to connect to, please make sure that `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` environment variable is set to the absolute path containing the certificates. You can make use of kubernetes secrets to mount the certificate file onto the containers.
:::

:::warning
To enable ToolJet AI features in your ToolJet deployment, whitelist `https://api-gateway.tooljet.ai`.
:::

4. Create k8s service

```bash
curl -LO https://tooljet-deployments.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/kubernetes/GKE/service.yaml
```

5. Create k8s ingress

```bash
curl -LO https://tooljet-deployments.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/kubernetes/GKE/ingress.yaml
```

Change the domain name to the domain/subdomain that you wish to use for ToolJet installation.

6. Apply YAML configs

```bash
kubectl apply -f certificate.yaml, deployment.yaml, service.yaml, ingress.yaml
```

:::info
It might take a few minutes to provision the managed certificates. [Managed certificates documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/managed-certs).
:::

You will be able to access your ToolJet installation once the pods, service and the ingress is running.

## ToolJet Database

Use the ToolJet-hosted database to build apps faster, and manage your data with ease. You can learn more about this feature [here](/docs/tooljet-db/tooljet-database).

Deploying ToolJet Database is mandatory from ToolJet 3.0 or else the migration might break. Checkout the following docs to know more about new major version, including breaking changes that require you to adjust your applications accordingly:

- [ToolJet 3.0 Migration Guide for Self-Hosted Versions](./upgrade-to-v3.md)

#### Setting Up ToolJet Database

To set up ToolJet Database, the following **environment variables are mandatory** and must be configured:

```env
TOOLJET_DB=
TOOLJET_DB_HOST=
TOOLJET_DB_USER=
TOOLJET_DB_PASS=
```

Additionally, for **PostgREST**, the following **mandatory** environment variables must be set:

:::tip
If you have openssl installed, you can run the 
command `openssl rand -hex 32` to generate the value for `PGRST_JWT_SECRET`.

If this parameter is not specified, PostgREST will refuse authentication requests.
:::

```env
PGRST_HOST=localhost:3001
PGRST_LOG_LEVEL=info
PGRST_DB_PRE_CONFIG=postgrest.pre_config
PGRST_SERVER_PORT=3001
PGRST_DB_URI=
PGRST_JWT_SECRET=
```

The **`PGRST_DB_URI`** variable is **required** for PostgREST, which exposes the database as a REST API. This must be explicitly set for proper functionality.

#### Format:

```env
PGRST_DB_URI=postgres://TOOLJET_DB_USER:TOOLJET_DB_PASS@TOOLJET_DB_HOST:5432/TOOLJET_DB
```

**Ensure these configurations are correctly set up before proceeding with the ToolJet deployment. Make sure these environment variables are set in the same environment as the ToolJet deployment.**

## Upgrading to the Latest LTS Version

New LTS versions are released every 3-5 months with an end-of-life of atleast 18 months. To check the latest LTS version, visit the [ToolJet Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tooljet/tooljet/tags) page. The LTS tags follow a naming convention with the prefix `LTS-` followed by the version number, for example `tooljet/tooljet:ee-lts-latest`.

If this is a new installation of the application, you may start directly with the latest version. This guide is not required for new installations.

#### Prerequisites for Upgrading to the Latest LTS Version:

- It is crucial to perform a **comprehensive backup of your database** before starting the upgrade process to prevent data loss.

- Users on versions earlier than **v2.23.0-ee2.10.2** must first upgrade to this version before proceeding to the LTS version.
