This guide explains how to implement a server side sort operation on the **Table** component in ToolJet.

## Add Table Component

Before implementing the sort operation, add the **Table** component and populate it with data:

1. Drag a **Table** component from the right component library to the canvas.
2. Select a data source and create a new query using the query panel at the bottom. We are going to use ToolJetâ€™s sample data source (Postgres) in this guide. Add the following query to fetch the data from the database:

```sql
SELECT * FROM public.sample_data_orders
LIMIT 100
```

3. Set the value of the **Data** property of the **Table** component to `{{queries.<query_name>.data}}` to populate the **Table** component with the data retrieved by the query.

## Server Side Sort

Follow the mentioned steps to perform server side sort operation on the **Table** component:

1. Enable Server Side Sort under the **Table** component properties.

2. Enter the following query:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM public.sample_data_orders 
{{components.table1.sortApplied ? `
    ORDER BY ${components.table1.sortApplied[0].column} 
    ${components.table1.sortApplied[0].direction}
` : ""}} 
LIMIT 100
```

*Note: Make sure to replace table1 with your **Table** name.*

3. Add an Event Handler to the **Table** component:<br/>
    Event: **Sort applied**<br/>
    Action: **Run Query**<br/>
    Query: **Select Your Query**

This will run the query and fetch the data every time a sort is applied.

4. Go to the Additional Actions section in the Table component's properties. Click the **fx** icon next to the Loading State and enter `{{queries.getOrders.isLoading}}` in the field to add a Loading State. *Note: Make sure to replace getOrders with your query name.*

This is how server side sort operation is implemented in ToolJet's **Table** component. When sorting is applied to a column in the **Table** component, the query is executed on the server, enabling sorting across the entire dataset. This ensures that the sorting is not limited to the data loaded into the **Table** but covers all records in the database.
