The GitSync feature enables synchronization of workspace applications with a git repository, streamlining application management and version control on ToolJet.

<div style={{paddingTop:'24px'}}>

## Overview

ToolJet applications can be synchronized with a Git repository, offering the flexibility to tailor your application development and deployment processes across various environments while aligning with best practices for the application development lifecycle.

#### Key Use-Cases

**Backup of Apps**

GitSync provides a straightforward solution for creating backups of your applications. By pushing changes to a Git repository, users can ensure a secure and versioned history of their application. This serves as a reliable backup mechanism, safeguarding against accidental application/version deletion or corruption.

**Environment Migration**

Facilitating the movement of applications across different ToolJet deployments (e.g., from development to staging to production), GitSync acts as a pivotal tool for environment migration. Users can effortlessly transfer their applications across environments by pushing changes to a Git repository.

## Setting up GitSync

:::info
- ToolJet support git repo managers like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, AWS CodeCommit, and Azure Repos.
- Only Admins have the permission to configure the GitSync feature on workspace level.
- The default branch name for the git repository should be **master**.
:::

### 1. Create a New Repository

Create a new repository on your git repo manager. The repository can be public or private. You can also use an existing repository. **Make sure that the repository is empty.**

<Tabs>

    <TabItem value="GitHub" label="GitHub"> 

        <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/gitsync/github1.png" alt="GitSync" />

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="GitLab" label="GitLab"> 

        <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/gitsync/gitlab/repo.png" alt="GitSync" />

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

### 2. Obtain the Repository URL

Obtain the **SSH URL** of your repository.

<Tabs>

    <TabItem value="GitHub" label="GitHub"> 

        When a repository is created, GitHub shows a screen with the repository URL. If the repository is already created, you can obtain the URL by clicking on the **Clone or download** button.
        <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/gitsync/github2.png" alt="GitSync" />

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="GitLab" label="GitLab"> 

        On GitLab, you can obtain the URL by clicking on the **Clone** button and selecting the **SSH** option.
        <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/gitsync/gitlab/gitlabssh.png" alt="GitSync" />

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

### 3. Configure the GitSync Feature on ToolJet

    1. Go to the **Workspace settings**, and click on the **Configure git** tab.

    <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/gitsync/gitsync.png" alt="GitLab Repo" />

    2. Enter the **SSH URL** of the repository (obtained in [Step 2](#2-obtain-the-repository-url)) in the **Git repo URL** field.
    3. Click on the **Generate SSH key** button, and copy the SSH key that is generated. The SSH key is used to authenticate ToolJet with the repository.

    <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/gitsync/ssh2-v2.png" alt="GitSync" />

    There are two types of generated SSH keys:
    - **ED25519**: This is a secure and efficient algorithm that is used for generating SSH keys. It is recommended to use this key type. VCS providers like GitHub and GitLab recommend using this key type
    - **RSA**: This is an older algorithm that is used for generating SSH keys. It is not recommended to use this key type. Older VCS providers like Bitbucket recommend using this key type.
