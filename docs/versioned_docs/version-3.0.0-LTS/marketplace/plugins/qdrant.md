title: Qdrant
---

Qdrant is a vector database which can be integrated with ToolJet to enable efficient vector search at scale. It supports AI applications with advanced technology for finding similar vectors.

At its core, Qdrant operates with points, which are records consisting of a vector and an optional payload which allows you to store additional context or metadata alongside the vectors for more meaningful searches.

## Connection

To connect with Qdrant, you will need Qdrant URL and an API key, which can be generated from [Qdrant Cloud Dashboard](https://qdrant.to/cloud).

### Query Points

Use this operation to search data points in a collection using a query, typically based on vector similarity or filtering conditions.

**Required Parameters**

- **Collection Name:** Identifies the dataset where the query will be executed.
- **Limit:** Specifies the maximum number of results to return.
- **Query:** A vector representing the query input used for similarity-based search.

**Optional Parameters**

- **With Vectors:** Indicates whether the vector data for the retrieved points should be included in the response (true or false).
- **Include Metadata:** Specifies if metadata associated with the points should be returned (true or false).
- **Filter:** Defines conditions to narrow down the search.
