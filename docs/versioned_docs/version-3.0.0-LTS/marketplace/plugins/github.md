ToolJet offers seamless integration with GitHub. This connection allows you to directly interact with GitHub repositories and data.

## Connection

To connect to GitHub, you need the following credential:
- **Personal Access Token**: You can generate this token through your **[GitHub Account Settings](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)**.

You'll need a Personal Access Token to access data from private repositories. Public repository data remains accessible without a Personal Access Token.
