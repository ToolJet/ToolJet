# Elasticsearch
ToolJet can connect to your Elasticsearch cluster to read and write data.

## Connection 
Please make sure the host/IP of the Elasticsearch cluster is accessible from your VPC if you have self-hosted ToolJet. If you are using ToolJet cloud, please **whitelist our IP**.

To add a new Elasticsearch database, click on the `+` button on data sources panel at the left-bottom corner of the app editor. Select Elasticsearch from the modal that pops up.

ToolJet requires the following to connect to your Elasticsearch cluster:
