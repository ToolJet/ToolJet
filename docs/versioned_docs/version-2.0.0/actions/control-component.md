## Using Component Specific Actions

### Set a value for text input widget using button's event handler

- Drag a **Text Input** and a **Button** widget onto the canvas.

- Go to the **Inspector** on the left sidebar to check the exposed variables available for the `textinput1` widget under the `components`. You'll see that the variable `value` is an empty string because the field value of the text input widget is empty right now.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

</div>

- Now enter some value in the text input widget and you'll see that the `value` in inspector has been updated.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

</div>

- Now, click on the button's widget handler to open up its properties in the right sidebar and then add a event handler for **On Click** event to trigger **Control Component** action. Select `textinput1` in component dropdown, `Set text` as Action, and in `Text` field enter the text that you want to update in the field value.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

</div>

- Now when you'll click on the button you'll see that the field value of the text input widget has been updated with value that you set.

</div>


### Clear value of text input widget using JavaScript query

- Let's clear the value that we set in the previous section, using Run JavaScript code. Create a new Run JavaScript Code query and call the component and the CSA that component provides.

**Syntax:**
```js
await components.textinput1.clear()
```

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![ToolJet - Action reference - Control Component](/img/actions/controlcomponent/jsoption.png)

</div>


<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![ToolJet - Action reference - Control Component](/img/actions/controlcomponent/clear.png)

</div>

- Finally, hit the **save and run** query button to fire up the query, and you'll see that the field value of the text input widget has been cleared.
