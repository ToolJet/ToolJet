### Modifying Tables with Foreign Key Constraints

When you are creating, updating, or deleting records in a table that has a foreign key constraint, you need to ensure that the foreign key constraint is not violated. 
- If you are trying to create/update a new row in the source table, you need to ensure that the foreign key value exists in the target table. Otherwise, the operation will fail with an error message.

</div>

- Similarly, if you are trying to delete a row in the target table, you need to ensure that the foreign key value is not being referenced in the source table.

### Join Tables

You can join two or more tables in the ToolJet database by using the **Join** operation.

#### Required Parameters
- **From**: In the From section, the following parameters are available:
    - **Selected Table**: Select the table from which you want to join the other table. 
    - **Type of Join**: Select the type of join you want to perform. The available options are: `Inner Join`, `Left Join`, `Right Join`, and `Full Outer Join`.
    - **Joining Table**: Select the table that you want to join with the selected table. If the selected table has a foreign key relationship(s) with other tables, those tables will be listed with a foreign key icon next to their name.
    - **On**: Select the column from the **selected table** and the **joining table** on which you want to join the tables. Currently, only `=` operation is supported for joining tables. If the selected table and the joining table have a foreign key relationship, both the columns will be auto-populated in the **On** dropdown.
