## Table UI

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

<img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/widgets/table/UI.png" alt="ToolJet - Widget Reference - Table" width="900" />

</div>

### Search

At the top-left corner of the table component, there is a search box that allows users to input keywords and search for rows within the table data. You can also **[show/hide the search box](/docs/widgets/table#show-search-box)** from the table from the table properties.

### Add new row

When users click on this button, a popup modal appears which enables them to insert new rows. The modal will have a single row initially, and the columns will have the same column type as those on the table. If the user inputs data into the row, it will be stored on the **[`newRows` variable](/docs/widgets/table#exposed-variables)** of the table. If the user selects the **Discard** button, the data in the variable will be cleared. However, if the user closes the popup without taking any action (neither Save nor Discard), the data will still be retained, and a green indicator will appear on the **Add new row** button. The table has an **[Add new rows event handler](/docs//widgets/table#add-new-rows)** that can be utilized to execute queries that store the data into the datasource whenever the **Save** button is clicked.

:::info
At present, it is not possible to include columns of type Image when adding a new row to the table.

### Filters

The table data can be filtered by clicking on this button. You have the option to choose from various filters, such as:

- **contains**
- **does not contain**
- **matches**
- **does not match**
- **equals**
- **does not equal**
- **is empty**
- **is not empty**
- **greater than**
- **greater than or equal to**
- **less than**
- **less than or equal to**

You have the option to **[hide the filter button](/docs/widgets/table#show-filter-button)** in the table properties.

### Download

The table data can be downloaded in various file formats, including:

- **CSV**
- **Excel**
- **PDF**

You have the option to **[hide the download button](/docs/widgets/table#show-download-button)** in the table properties.

### Column selector button

You can choose which columns to display or hide in the table by clicking on this button. You also have the option to **[hide the column selector button](/docs/widgets/table#show-column-selector-button)** in the table properties.

## Table data

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

<img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/widgets/table/data.png" alt="ToolJet - Widget Reference - Table" width="350" />

</div>

Array of objects to be displayed on the table. It is commonly used to display data from query (`{{queries.restapi1.data}}`). Table data expects an array of objects, example: 

```
{{[{ id: 1, name: 'Sarah', email: 'sarah@example.com'}]}}
```

The table component will **auto-generate all the columns** as soon as the expected table data(array of objects) is provided.

## Columns

Whenever data is loaded into a table, the columns are automatically generated. You can add, remove, or modify columns by accessing the table properties under the column section.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

<img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/widgets/table/columntypes.png" alt="ToolJet - Widget Reference - Table" />

</div>

### Types of Columns

The table provides different column types based on the data being displayed:

- [String | Default](#string--default)
- [Number](#number)
- [Badge](#badge)
- [Multiple Badges](#multiple-badges)
- [Tags](#tags)
- [Dropdown](#dropdown)
- [Radio](#radio)

The "Image" column type is used to display images in the column cells using the column data. The cell value of this column should be a URL of the image, and it will be displayed in the cell.

By default, when an image is loaded in the column, its width is set to 100%. The border radius, width, and height of the image can be adjusted in the column properties.

The "Object fit" option allows you to choose how the image should be fitted within its container. The options are:

- "Cover": maintains the aspect ratio of the image but may crop or clip parts of it to cover the container's width.
- "Contain": maintains the aspect ratio and resizes the image to fit within the given dimensions while displaying the entire image.
- "Fill": stretches the image to cover 100% of the width.

:::info
Check this **[how-to guide](/docs/how-to/access-cellvalue-rowdata)** on dynamically change the color of text in a row and column in the table.
:::

### Displaying Data

The data object should be an array of objects. Table columns can be added, removed, rearranged from the inspector. `key` property is the accessor key used to get data from a single element of a table data object. For example:

If the table data is:

```js
[
    {
        "review": {
            "title": "An app review"
        },
    "user": {
            "name": "sam",
            "email": "sam@example.com"
        },
    }
]
```

To display email column, the key for the column should be `user.email`.


### Saving data
Enable `editable` property of a column to make the cells editable. If a data type is not selected, `string` is selected as the data type.

:::tip
You can programatically **enable**/**disable** the make **editable** field in the columns property by clicking on the **Fx** button.
:::

If the data in a cell is changed, `changeSet` property of the table object will have the index of the row and the field that changed.
For example, if the name field of second row of example in the 'Displaying Data' section is changed, `changeSet` will look like this:

```js
{
    2: {
        "name": "new name"
    }
}
```

Along with `changeSet`, `dataUpdates` property will also be changed when the value of a cell changes. `dataUpdates` will have the whole data of the changed index from the table data. `dataUpdates` will look like this for our example:

```js
[{
    "review": {
        "title": "An app review"
    },
    "user": {
        "name": "new name",
        "email": "sam@example.com"
    },
}]
```

If the data of a cell is changed, "save changes" button will be shown at the bottom of the table. This button when clicked will trigger the `Bulk update query` event. This event can be used to run a query to update the data on your data source.

### Use dynamic column

Enabling the **Use dynamic column** toggle will allow users to set the **Column data** where users can link the column data dynamically from a query. 

The **column data** field expects a JSON value:
```json
{
   "name":"Name",
   "columnType":"string",
   "key":"first_name",
   "cellBackgroundColor":"#000",
   "textColor":"#fff",
   "isEditable":true,
   "regex":"",
   "maxLength":10,
   "minLength":5,
   "customRule":""
}
```

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

<img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/widgets/table/dynamic_column.png" alt="ToolJet - Widget Reference - Table" />

</div>

## Validation

Under column properties, expand the detailed view of a column type to access a toggle button called `make editable`. You can toggle it `ON` to apply the validations for each column respectively using the following.

### Regex

Use this field to enter a Regular Expression that will validate the password constraints.
### Min length

Enter the number for a minimum length of password allowed.

### Max length

Enter the number for the maximum length of password allowed.

### Custom validation

If the condition is true, the validation passes, otherwise return a string that should be displayed as the error message. For example: `{{components.passwordInput1.value === 'something' ? true: 'value should be something'}}`

## Action buttons

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

<img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/widgets/table/action2.png" alt="ToolJet - Widget Reference - Table" width="800" />

</div>

Action buttons will be displayed as the last column of the table. The styles of these buttons can be customised and `on click` actions can be configured. when clicked, `selectedRow` property of the table will have the table data of the row.

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ------------ |
| Button text | Set the text that you want to be displayed on the action button. |
| Button position | Set the button position to the left or right |
| Background color (Action Button) | Background color of the action button. |
| Text color (Action Button) | Color of button-text of the action button. |
| Disable Action Button | Toggle on to disable the action button. You can programmatically set its value by clicking on the `Fx` button next to it, if set to `{{true}}`, the action button will be disabled and becomes non-functional. By default, its value is set to `{{false}}`. |

## Options

:::info

### Server-side pagination

Server-side pagination can be used to run a query whenever the page is changed. Go to events section of the inspector and change the action for `on page changed` event. Number of records per page needs to be handled in your query. If server-side pagination is enabled, `pageIndex` property will be exposed on the table object, this property will have the current page index. `pageIndex` can be used to query the next set of results when page is changed.

When Server-side pagination is enabled, you'll be able to set three other table properties:
- **Enable previous page button**: When server-side pagination is enabled, this button is enabled by default. Toggle this off to disable the previous page button from the table.
- **Enable next page button**: When server-side pagination is enabled, this button is enabled by default. Toggle this off to disable the next page button from the table.
- **Total records server side**: Set a numerical value to display particular number of records.

### Client-side pagination

Client-side pagination is enabled by default. When the client-side pagination is enabled(`{{true}}`), another property **Number of rows per page** will be shown that can be used to set the number of records per page. By default, the value is set to 10 and if it is disabled(`{{false}}`) then it will show all the records in the single page.

### Server-side search

If server-side search is enabled, `on search` event is fired after the content of `searchText` property is changed. `searchText` can be used to run a specific query to search for the records in your data source.

### Show download button

The download button in the table header is visible by default. You can choose to hide it by disabling this option. You can dynamically set the value to {{true}} or {{false}} to show or hide the download button by clicking on the **Fx** button.

### Show column selector button

The column selector button on the table header is visible by default. You can choose to hide it by disabling this option. You can dynamically set the value to {{true}} or {{false}} to show or hide the column selector button by clicking on the **Fx** button.

### Show filter button

The filter button in the table header is visible by default. You can choose to hide it by disabling this option. You can dynamically set the value to {{true}} or {{false}} to show or hide the filter button by clicking on the **Fx** button.

### Show update buttons

It's enabled by default. Table footer will show two update buttons **Save changes** & **Discard changes** whenever a cell is edited. Toggle `off` to hide update buttons.

### Bulk selection

To let the user select one or more rows from the current page of a table, enable 'Bulk selection' from the inspector. The values of selected rows will be exposed as `selectedRows`.

### Highlight selected row

Enable this option to have the last selected(clicked on) row to be highlighted.

### Disable sorting

Enable this option to lock the sorting of columns when clicked on column name.

### Server-side sort
When Server-side sort is enabled, clicking on the column headers will not automatically sort the table, instead, the `Sort applied` event will be fired and the applied sorting will be exposed as `sortApplied`. You can use this data to run any query that feeds data to the table in a manner that reflects the sorting applied.

### Server-side filter
When Server-side filter is enabled, applying filters will not automatically filter the table, instead, the `Filter changed` event will be fired and the applied filters will be exposed as `filters`. You can use this data to run any query that feeds data to the table in a manner that reflects the filters applied.

### Show search box

It can be used to show or hide Table Search box. Client-side search is enabled by default and server-side search can be enabled from the events section of the inspector. Whenever the search text is changed, the `searchText` property of the table component is updated. If server-side search is enabled, `on search` event is fired after the content of `searchText` property is changed. `searchText` can be used to run a specific query to search for the records in your data source.

If you don't wish to use the search feature altogether, you can disable it from the inspector.

### Loading state (Boolean)

Loading state shows a loading skeleton for the table. This property can be used to show a loading status on the table while data is being loaded. `isLoading` property of a query can be used to get the status of a query.
