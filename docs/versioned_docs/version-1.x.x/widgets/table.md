# Table

Tables can be used for both displaying and editing data.

<iframe height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hTrdkUtz3aA" title="ToolJet Table Widget" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen width="100%"></iframe>

## Table data

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

<img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/widgets/table/data.png" alt="ToolJet - Widget Reference - Table" width="400" />

</div>

Array of objects to be displayed on the table. It is commonly used to display data from query (`{{queries.restapi1.data}}`). Table data expects an array of objects, example: 

```
{{[{ id: 1, name: 'Sarah', email: 'sarah@example.com'}]}}
```

The table component will **auto-generate all the columns** as soon as the expected table data(array of objects) is provided.

## Columns

</div>

### Cell data types

You can define the cell types as per your table's data source using the following:

- <b>String | Default</b>: It is used to render the data for cell types: <i>text or textarea</i>,
- <b>Number</b>: This cell type will only expect the <b>numerical</b> values and can be sorted in ascending or descending order
- <b>Badge</b>: It is a labeling component used to display data with badges for e.g <b><i>status of a shipment</i></b>
- <b>Multiple badges</b>: Similar to badge, used to display multiple data badges in the form of array of objects,
- <b>Tags</b>: Used to display an array of objects in the form of tags, e.g <b><i>status, levels, steps</i></b>
- <b>Dropdown</b>: When data is in the form of an array of options to be selected, e.g <b><i>select priority</i></b>
- <b>Radio</b>: Used to make a selection from a group of options, e.g <b><i>select your salary-range</i></b>
- <b>Multiselect</b>: Similar to dropdown but to collect multiple user inputs from a list of options,
- <b>Toggle switch</b>: Allows a user to change a setting between two states, e.g <b><i>select between Yes/No</i></b>,
- <b>Date picker</b>: Allowing users to display and select dates, e.g <b><i>delivery date</i></b>
- <b>Image</b>: This cell type expects the URL of image and will display the image in the cell. It also has the option to style the image.

### Displaying Data

The data object should be an array of objects. Table columns can be added, removed, rearranged from the inspector. `key` property is the accessor key used to get data from a single element of a table data object. For example:

If the table data is:

```js
[
    {
        "review": {
            "title": "An app review"
        },
    "user": {
            "name": "sam",
            "email": "sam@example.com"
        },
    }
]
```

To display email column, the key for the column should be `user.email`.


### Saving data
Enable `editable` property of a column to make the cells editable. If a data type is not selected, `string` is selected as the data type.

If the data in a cell is changed, `changeSet` property of the table object will have the index of the row and the field that changed.
For example, if the name field of second row of example in the 'Displaying Data' section is changed, `changeSet` will look like this:

```js
{
    2: {
        "name": "new name"
    }
}
```

Along with `changeSet`, `dataUpdates` property will also be changed when the value of a cell changes. `dataUpdates` will have the whole data of the changed index from the table data. `dataUpdates` will look like this for our example:

```js
[{
    "review": {
        "title": "An app review"
    },
    "user": {
        "name": "new name",
        "email": "sam@example.com"
    },
}]
```

If the data of a cell is changed, "save changes" button will be shown at the bottom of the table. This button when clicked will trigger the `Bulk update query` event. This event can be used to run a query to update the data on your data source.

## Validation

Under column properties, expand the detailed view of a column type to access a toggle button called `make editable`. You can toggle it `ON` to apply the validations for each column respectively using the following.

### Regex

Use this field to enter a Regular Expression that will validate the password constraints.
### Min length

Enter the number for a minimum length of password allowed.

### Max length

Enter the number for the maximum length of password allowed.

### Custom validation

If the condition is true, the validation passes, otherwise return a string that should be displayed as the error message. For example: `{{components.passwordInput1.value === 'something' ? true: 'value should be something'}}`

## Action buttons

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

<img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/widgets/table/action.png" alt="ToolJet - Widget Reference - Table" width="400" />

</div>

Action buttons will be displayed as the last column of the table. The styles of these buttons can be customised and `on click` actions can be configured. when clicked, `selectedRow` property of the table will have the table data of the row.

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ------------ |
| Background color (Action Button) | Background color of the action button. |
| Text color (Action Button) | Color of button-text of the action button. |

## Options

### Server-side pagination

Server-side pagination can be used to run a query whenever the page is changed. Go to events section of the inspector and change the action for `on page changed` event. Number of records per page needs to be handled in your query. If server-side pagination is enabled, `pageIndex` property will be exposed on the table object, this property will have the current page index. `pageIndex` can be used to query the next set of results when page is changed.

When Server-side pagination is enabled, you'll be able to set three other table properties:
- **Enable previous page button**: When server-side pagination is enabled, this button is enabled by default. Toggle this off to hide the previous page button from the table.
- **Enable next page button**: When server-side pagination is enabled, this button is enabled by default. Toggle this off to hide the next page button from the table.
- **Total records server side**: Set a numerical value to display particular number of records.

### Client-side pagination

Client-side pagination is enabled by default. When the client-side pagination is enabled(`{{true}}`), another property **Number of rows per page** will be shown that can be used to set the number of records per page. By default, the value is set to 10 and if it is disabled(`{{false}}`) then it will show all the records in the single page.

### Server-side search

If server-side search is enabled, `on search` event is fired after the content of `searchText` property is changed. `searchText` can be used to run a specific query to search for the records in your data source.

### Show download button

Show or hide download button at the Table footer.

### Hide/Show columns

Table header has an option(Eye icon) to show/hide one or many columns on the table. 

### Show filter button

Show or hide filter button at the Table header. The following filters are available:
- **contains**
- **does not contain**
- **matches**
- **does not match**
- **equals**
- **does not equal to**
- **is empty**
- **is not empty**
- **greater than**
- **greater than or equal to**
- **less than**
- **less than or equal to**


### Show update buttons

It's enabled by default. Table footer will show two update buttons **Save changes** & **Discard changes** whenever a cell is edited. Toggle `off` to hide update buttons.

### Bulk selection

To let the user select one or more rows from the current page of a table, enable 'Bulk selection' from the inspector. The values of selected rows will be exposed as `selectedRows`.

### Highlight selected row

Enable this option to have the last selected(clicked on) row to be highlighted.

### Disable sorting

Enable this option to lock the sorting of columns when clicked on column name.

### Server-side sort
When Server-side sort is enabled, clicking on the column headers will not automatically sort the table, instead, the `Sort applied` event will be fired and the applied sorting will be exposed as `sortApplied`. You can use this data to run any query that feeds data to the table in a manner that reflects the sorting applied.

### Server-side filter
When Server-side filter is enabled, applying filters will not automatically filter the table, instead, the `Filter changed` event will be fired and the applied filters will be exposed as `filters`. You can use this data to run any query that feeds data to the table in a manner that reflects the filters applied.

### Show search box

It can be used to show or hide Table Search box. Client-side search is enabled by default and server-side search can be enabled from the events section of the inspector. Whenever the search text is changed, the `searchText` property of the table component is updated. If server-side search is enabled, `on search` event is fired after the content of `searchText` property is changed. `searchText` can be used to run a specific query to search for the records in your data source.

If you don't wish to use the search feature altogether, you can disable it from the inspector.

### Loading state (Boolean)

Loading state shows a loading skeleton for the table. This property can be used to show a loading status on the table while data is being loaded. `isLoading` property of a query can be used to get the status of a query.
