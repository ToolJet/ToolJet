ToolJet supports automatic SSO login for your workspace, allowing users to bypass the login screen and directly access the application when only one SSO method is configured.

### Configuring Automatic SSO Login

To enable automatic SSO login, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that only one SSO method is enabled for your workspace.

2. Disable password login for your workspace.

3. Add the following variable to your [enviroment variables](/docs/setup/env-vars#sso-configurations-optional):

``` yaml
SSO_SKIP_LOGIN_SCREEN = true
```
