ToolJet does not store any data fetched from the data sources. ToolJet acts as a proxy and the data from data sources is sent to the client application without storing.

ToolJet tracks anonymous usage data such as page loads and clicks. **ToolJet tracks only the events and doesn't capture data from data sources.**

Tracking can be disabled by setting the value environment variable `ENABLE_TRACKING` to `0`.
