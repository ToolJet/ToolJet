Welcome to the ToolJet Documentation guide! We're thrilled to have you here and can't wait to see the contributions you'll make to our docs. Your insights and improvements will help thousands of users get the most out of ToolJet ðŸš€.

In the following sections, you'll find everything you need to get started with contributing to our documentation. 

## What Makes Good Documentation?

Good documentation is all about clarity, simplicity, and effectiveness. It should guide users through the usage and workings of ToolJet with precision, making it as easy as possible for them to build and deploy internal tools.

Documentation is a cornerstone of our product. It's one of the most visited sections of our website, second only to our homepage. Without well-crafted, thorough documentation, users can't fully utilize the power of ToolJet, and their experience may suffer as a result.

### The Golden Rule

If a ToolJet feature lacks comprehensive documentation, it isn't considered complete. Quality documentation is essential for the success of our product and the satisfaction of our users. Itâ€™s often through documentation that users discover new features or decide to upgrade their tools.

As a contributor, you can create detailed, user-centric content that thoroughly covers the features you're documenting in an engaging and accurate way.

## Types of Documentation

We aim to create rich, informative content across three key areas of documentation:

1. **ToolJet Concepts**: Basic explanations of specific topics, offering general insights into how ToolJet features work.
2. **How-to Guides**: Step-by-step instructions that help users accomplish specific tasks within ToolJet.
3. **Reference**: Concise, lookup-style documentation that covers all possible usages, definitions, and edge cases for ToolJet features.

As you document features, consider which of these categories your content fits best. Sometimes a feature might require multiple types of documentation to be fully covered.

### Measuring Impact and Gathering Feedback

The quality of our documentation isn't just determined by how well it's writtenâ€”it's also measured by how well it serves our users. We regularly use analytics and feedback tools to assess the impact of our documentation and make data-driven improvements.

## Next Steps...

Once you've set up your local environment, take some time to explore our [Style Guide](style-guide.md), understand our page structures, and learn how to work with Docusaurus, the framework we use for our documentation.

We look forward to your contributions and are excited to see how you'll help make ToolJet documentation even better!
