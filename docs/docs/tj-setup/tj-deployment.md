## Self-Hosted ToolJet

With the self-hosted option, ToolJet can be deployed on your own infrastructure (on-premises or private cloud). This provides more control over data, customization, and integrations, making it an ideal choice for organizations seeking full control over their application development environment to meet compliance, security, and operational requirements.

#### Why Choose Self-Hosted ToolJet?

1. **Complete Data Control**: Deploying ToolJet on your infrastructure ensures your data stays within your control, meeting stringent compliance and privacy requirements.
2. **Customizability**: Self-hosted deployments allow for deeper customization to align with your organization's workflows, integrations, and unique needs.
3. **Enhanced Security**: By hosting ToolJet on-premises or in your private cloud, you can implement your own security measures, providing an added layer of protection for sensitive data.
