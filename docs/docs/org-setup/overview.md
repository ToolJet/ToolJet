In ToolJet, an **organization** is a centralized entity that helps structure and manage collaborative app development. It serves as a space for teams to work together on building, testing, and deploying applications. Organizations also allow admins and super admins to manage users and resources centrally. The organization can also be divided into different workspaces based on specific requirements. This section outlines key setup areas, including branding, subscription plans, deployment options, and workspace management, ensuring an optimized experience for your team.

## Deployment Options and Subcription Plans

ToolJet offers two deployment options — **Self-Hosted** and **Cloud** — allowing users to choose their preferred deployment model. Along with deployment options, ToolJet offers various subcription plans for both the deployment model with different features and offerings. 

## Instances and Workspaces

In ToolJet, a self-hosted deployment of the platform is referred to as an instance, where each instance operates independently with its own configurations, data, and user base. Within each instance, workspaces provide isolated spaces for different teams or projects, enabling users to manage apps, resources, and access controls effectively. Each workspace can be customized to meet specific requirements, ensuring efficient collaboration and streamlined workflows.

## Organization Branding

ToolJet offers customization through white labeling and custom domain setup, allowing you to tailor your instance to align with your brand guidelines. White labeling ensures the platform reflects your organization’s brand identity, while a custom domain lets you use your own web address for the ToolJet instance. Additionally, ToolJet enables you to set up your email server for managing tasks like sending invitations and password reset requests, ensuring seamless communication both within your team and with external users.
