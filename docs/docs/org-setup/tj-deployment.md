## Self-Hosted ToolJet

With the self-hosted option, ToolJet can be deployed on your own infrastructure (on-premises or cloud). This provides more control over data, customization, and integrations, making it a preferred choice for organizations with stringent compliance or privacy requirements.

#### Why to use Self-Hosted ToolJet?

1. **Complete Data Control**: Deploying ToolJet on your infrastructure ensures your data stays within your control, meeting stringent compliance and privacy requirements.
2. **Customizability**: Self-hosted deployments allow for deeper customization to align with your organization's workflows, integrations, and unique needs.
3. **Enhanced Security**: By hosting ToolJet on-premises or in your private cloud, you can implement your own security measures, providing an added layer of protection for sensitive data.
