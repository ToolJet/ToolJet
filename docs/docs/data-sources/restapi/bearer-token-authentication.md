title: Bearer Token Authentication
---

ToolJetâ€™s REST API data source supports Bearer Token as the authentication type. Bearer Token is a security token that is issued by the authentication server to the client. The client then uses the token to access the protected resources hosted by the resource server.

### Configuring REST API Data Source with Bearer Token

1. Go to the **Data Sources** page from the ToolJet dashboard, select **API** category on sidebar and choose the **REST API** data source.
2. In the **Base URL** field, enter the base URL. The base URL specifies the network address of the API service. For example, `http://localhost:3001/api/bearer-auth`
3. Enter the **Headers** if required. Headers are key-value pairs to include as headers with REST API requests.
4. Select **Authentication** type as *Bearer* from the dropdown.
5. Enter the **Token** in the field. The token is a security token that is issued by the authentication server to the client. The client then uses the token to access the protected resources hosted by the resource server.

6. Now you have option to select the **SSL Certificate** if required. SSL certificate is used to verify the server certificate. By default, it is set to *None*. You can provide the **CA Certificate** or **Client Certificate** from the dropdown.
    1. **CA Certificate**: Requires a CA certificate to verify the server certificate. Copy the content of `server.crt` file and paste it in the **CA Cert** field. `server.crt` file is the certificate file that is used to verify the server certificate.

    2. **Client Certificate**: Requires a client certificate to authenticate with the server. **client.key**, **client.crt**, and **server.crt** files are the certificate files that are used to authenticate with the server. Copy the content of **client.key** file and paste it in the **Client Key** field. Copy the content of **client.crt** file and paste it in the **Client Cert** field. Copy the content of **server.crt** file and paste it in the **CA Cert** field.

7. Once you have configured the REST API data source, click on the **Save** button.

### Authenticating REST API

Create a query to make a `GET` request to the URL, and it will return a success message if the token is valid.
