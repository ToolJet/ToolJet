# Google Sheets

ToolJet has the capability to establish a connection with Google Sheet for both reading and writing data. By utilizing OAuth 2.0, ToolJet can establish a secure connection with Google Sheet, ensuring that the application's access to a user's account is restricted and limited appropriately.

## Self-Hosted Configuration

If you decide to self-host ToolJet, there are a few additional steps you need to take:

1. Proceed with the setup steps provided in the [Google OAuth 2.0 guide](/docs/setup/env-vars#google-oauth--optional-) to configure the necessary settings.
2. Assign the corresponding values obtained from the previous step to the following environment variables:
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `TOOLJET_HOST`
3. Activate the Google Sheets API within the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) console.

## Connection

To establish a connection with Google Sheet, you have two options. First, you can click on the **+Add new global datasource** button found on the query panel. Alternatively, you can go to the **[Global Datasources](/docs/data-sources/overview)** page within the ToolJet dashboard.

### Authorization Scopes

When connecting to a Google Sheets datasource, you can choose between two permission scopes:

1. **Read Only**: This scope allows you to access and retrieve data from the Google Sheet.
2. **Read and Write**: This scope grants you both read and write permissions, enabling you to retrieve and modify data within the Google Sheet.

## Querying Google Sheet

To perform operations on a Google Sheet, click the `+Add` button in the query manager located at the bottom panel of the app builder. Select the Google Sheet datasource under the Global datasource section. Choose the desired operation from the dropdown and click **Save** to save the query.

Using Google sheets data source you can perform several operations from your applications like:

  1. **[Read data from a sheet](/docs/data-sources/google.sheets#read-data-from-a-sheet)**
  2. **[Append data to a sheet](/docs/data-sources/google.sheets#append-data-to-a-sheet)**
  3. **[Update single row of a sheet](/docs/data-sources/google.sheets#update-single-row-of-a-sheet)**
  4. **[Delete row from a sheet](/docs/data-sources/google.sheets#delete-row-from-a-sheet)**
  5. **[Get spreadsheet info](/docs/data-sources/google.sheets#get-spreadsheet-info)**

Add additional rows to a table by using the append operation.

| Fields      | description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Spreadsheet ID | Entering the spreadsheet ID is required and can be obtained from the URL of the spreadsheet. For example, in the URL `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W2S4re7zNaPk9vqv6_CqOpPdm_mDEqmLmzjVe7Nb9WM/edit#gid=0`, the `1W2S4re7zNaPk9vqv6_CqOpPdm_mDEqmLmzjVe7Nb9WM` represents the spreadsheet ID. |
| Sheet | This is optional. You can specify `sheet name` if it has more than 1 sheets, else it will automatically choose the first sheet. |
