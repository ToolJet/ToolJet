# Amazon S3

ToolJet can connect to Amazon S3 buckets and perform various operation on them.

## Connection

To add a new S3 source, go to the **Datasources manager** on the left sidebar of the app editor and click on `Add datasource` button. Select **AWS S3** from the modal that pops up.

ToolJet requires the following to connect to your DynamoDB:

- **Region**
- **Access key**
- **Secret key**

It is recommended to create a new IAM user for the database so that you can control the access levels of ToolJet.

Click on **Test connection** button to verify if the credentials are correct and that the database is accessible to ToolJet server. Click on **Save** button to save the data source.

## Querying AWS S3

Click on `+` button of the **query manager** at the bottom panel of the editor and select the data source added in the previous step as the data source. Select the operation that you want to perform and click **Save** to save the query.
