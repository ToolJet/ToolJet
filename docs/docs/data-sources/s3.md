# Amazon S3

ToolJet can connect to Amazon S3 buckets and perform various operation on them.

## Connection

To add a new S3 source, go to the **Datasources manager** on the left sidebar of the app editor and click on `Add datasource` button. Select **AWS S3** from the modal that pops up.

ToolJet requires the following to connect to your AWS S3:

- **Region**
- **Access key**
- **Secret key**

It is recommended to create a new IAM user for the database so that you can control the access levels of ToolJet.

</div>

Click on **Test connection** button to verify if the credentials are correct and that the database is accessible to ToolJet server. Click on **Save** button to save the data source.

## Querying AWS S3

Click on `+` button of the **query manager** at the bottom panel of the editor and select the data source added in the previous step as the data source. Select the operation that you want to perform and click **Save** to save the query.

Click on the **run** button to run the query. 

**NOTE**: Query should be saved before running.

:::tip
Query results can be transformed using transformations. Read our transformations documentation to see how: **[link](/docs/tutorial/transformations)**

## Query operations

You can create query for AWS S3 data source to perform several actions such as:
  1. **[Read object](/docs/data-sources/s3#read-object)**
  2. **[Upload object](/docs/data-sources/s3#upload-object)**
  3. **[List buckets](/docs/data-sources/s3#list-buckets)**
  4. **[List objects in a bucket](/docs/data-sources/s3#list-objects-in-a-bucket)**
  5. **[Signed url for download](/docs/data-sources/s3#signed-url-for-download)**
  6. **[Signed url for upload](/docs/data-sources/s3#signed-url-for-upload)**

### Read object

You can read an object in a bucket by using this operation. It requires two parameters - **Bucket** name and **Key**.

</div>

### Upload object

You can use this operation to upload objects(files) to your S3 bucket. It requires four parameters:
  1. **Bucket**: Specify the bucket name
  2. **Key**: Key of the object/file
  3. **Content type**: Specify file type such as text, image etc. 
  4. **Upload data**: File/object that is to be uploaded.

### List buckets

This operation will list all the buckets in your S3. This does not require any parameter.

</div>

###  List objects in a bucket

This operation will fetch the list of all the files in your bucket. It requires two parameters:
  1. **Bucket**: Bucket name (mandatory)
  2. **Prefix**: To limit the response to keys that begin with the specified prefix (optional)

</div>

### Signed url for download

The object owner can optionally share objects with others by creating a presigned URL, using their own security credentials, to grant time-limited permission to download the objects. For creating a presigned URL, the required parameters are:
  1. **Bucket**: name of the bucket for uploading the file
  2. **Key**: an object key
  3. **Expires in**: an expiration time of URL

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

</div>

### Signed url for upload

The presigned URLs are useful if you want your user/customer to be able to upload a specific object to your bucket, but you don't require them to have AWS security credentials or permissions. For creating a presigned URL, the required parameters are:
  1. **Bucket**: name of the bucket for uploading the file
  2. **Key**: an object key
  3. **Expires in**: an expiration time of URL
  4. **Content type**: the content type such as text, image etc.
