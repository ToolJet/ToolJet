This page details the system requirements for setting up and running our software, including both Docker local setups and server deployments. Tailor your setup to match these requirements for optimal performance.

## Docker Local Setup Requirements

#### Windows
For users setting up Docker locally on a Windows machine:
- **RAM**: Minimum of 16GB RAM is required.

#### Mac
For Docker setups on Mac systems:
- **RAM**: It is recommended to have 16GB RAM.

## Server Requirements

The basic requirements for server setups are as follows:
- **RAM**: Minimum of 2GB.
- **CPU**: At least 1 CPU core.

Adjustments can be made based on specific needs and the expected load on the server.

## Bare-Metal Setup

For those opting for a **[bare-metal setup](/docs/contributing-guide/setup/docker)** instead of Docker:
- **RAM**: 8GB RAM is sufficient for a bare-metal setup.

Please ensure your system meets these requirements before proceeding with the installation. Adjustments to the server specifications should be made considering the specific demands of your deployment scenario.
