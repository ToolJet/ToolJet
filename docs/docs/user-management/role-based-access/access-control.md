ToolJet enables you to manage access control by configuring permissions like create and delete. Access control can be applied to all of your resources such as apps and data sources. Additionally, ToolJet supports granular access control, allowing you to configure permissions for individual resources to ensure precise and secure management.

## Permissions

The following permissions can be configured for the given resources:
| Resource                    | Permission            | Description                                                                                 |
|:----------------------------|:----------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Apps**                    | Create                | Allows users of the group to create new applications within the workspace.                  |
|                             | Delete                | Allows users of the group to delete applications from the workspace.                        |
| **Data sources**            | Create                | Allows users of the group to add new data sources in the workspace.                         |
|                             | Delete                | Allows users of the group to remove data sources from the workspace.                        |
| **Folder**                  | Create/Update/Delete  | Allows users of the group to create, update, or delete folders to organize resources.       |
| **Workspace constants/variables** | Create/Update/Delete | Allows users of the group to define, modify, or remove constants and variables used across the workspace. |

To configure view or edit access, please refer to **[Granular Access Control](#granular-access-control)**.

:::info
If a user has the create permission and creates a resource, the user becomes the owner of that resource and has all the permissions related to it by default. <br/>
For example, if a user creates a data source A, then by default, the user will have the configure and build access for data source A.

## Granular Access Control

In ToolJet, you can set granular level access control for apps and data sources, by configuring permissions like view access or edit access, to manage who can interact with the resources in your workspace. You can apply permissions either to all resources (e.g., all apps or all data sources) or to specific, selected resources, offering flexibility and precision in managing access. <br/>
To configure Granular Access Control, you need to create custom groups. Refer to **[custom groups](/docs/user-management/role-based-access/custom-groups)** guide for more information.

### Apps

- **Edit**: Grants edit access to the selected apps. With this access, users can build or edit the apps they are granted access to. This permission should be assigned to builders or developers.

- **View**: With view access, users can view the released version of the selected apps and use them to perform tasks. This access does not allow users to edit or make changes to the apps. This permission should be assigned to end users or the consumers.

- **Hide from dashboard**: Hides the selected apps from the dashboard, making them accessible only via URL for users with view access. While the users with edit access can always see the app on the dashboard.

- **All apps**: Provides the selected access (Edit or View) to all the apps in the workspace, including any newly created apps.

- **Custom**: Provide the selected access (Edit or View) only to the specified apps.

### Data Sources

- **Configure**: Users in the group can access and edit the configuration details of the selected data sources. This permission should be given to the admin users who needs to configure the data source.

- **Build with**: Users in the group can use the selected data sources in apps and workflows to create queries. This permission should be given to the builders or developers who will create the queries for the apps or workflows.

- **All data sources**: Provides the selected access (Configure or Build with) to all the data sources in the workspace, including any newly created data source.

- **Custom**: Provide the selected access (Configure or Build with) only to the specified data sources.
