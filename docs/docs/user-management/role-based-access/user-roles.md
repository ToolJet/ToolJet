title: User Roles

ToolJet enables you to use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system to manage security and access to your resources such as apps, data sources and workspace variables, etc. ToolJet provides a set of pre-defined user roles and the ability to create **[custom groups](/docs/user-management/role-based-access/custom-groups)** for more granular access control. User roles are taken into account for licensing and billing purposes, refer **[ToolJet Pricing](https://www.tooljet.com/pricing)** for more information.

## Default User Roles

ToolJet has three default user roles at the workspace level, each with different levels of access:

1. **Admin**: An admin is a user with access to manage settings, control user permissions, and oversee the overall functionality. The admin user has full access to all resources.
2. **Builder**: A builder is a user responsible for creating, customizing, and configuring the application.
3. **End-user**: An end user is a consumer who interacts with the final application to perform tasks or achieve specific goals. 

## Permissions for User Roles

Admin user has access to all the permission at workspace level, while an end user can only view and use the released apps they are given access to and permissions can be configured for a builder.

| Resource  | Permission | Admin | Builder | End User |
|:----------|:-----------|:-----------:|:---:|:---:|
| **Apps**  | Create/Update/Delete     | ✅ | Configurable | ❌ |
|           | View     | ✅ | Configurable | Configurable |
| **Data sources**  | Create/Update/Delete  | ✅ | Configurable | ❌ |
| **Folder**        | Create/Update/Delete  | ✅ | Configurable | ❌ |
| **Workspace constants/variables** | Create/Update/Delete | ✅ | Configurable | ❌ |
