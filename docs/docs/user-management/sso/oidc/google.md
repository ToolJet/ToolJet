Google can be configured as the Identity Provider for OIDC, which is an authentication protocol that securely verifies user identities through a trusted provider. This document explains how to obtain the required credentials from the Google console. Refer to the **[OIDC Setup](/docs/user-management/sso/oidc/setup)** Guide to configure OIDC in your application.

4. You'll be led to an app registration page, fill out the required details and click on **SAVE AND CONTINUE** button at the bottom.

5. On the second page you can set OAuth scopes. Select **ADD OR REMOVE SCOPES** and add the scopes **userinfo.email** and **userinfo.profile** as shown in the image. This will allow ToolJet to store the email and name of the user who is signing in. Click on **SAVE AND CONTINUE**.

Select Application type and give a name, under **Authorised JavaScript origins**, set the domain on which ToolJet is hosted and under **Authorized redirect URIs**, enter the Redirect URL which was generated in ToolJet's Google SSO settings.
