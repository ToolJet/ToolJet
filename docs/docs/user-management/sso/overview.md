Single Sign-On (SSO) is an authentication process that allows users to access multiple applications or services with a single set of login credentials. By eliminating the need to log in separately to each application, SSO enhances user experience and security.

Companies use SSO to simplify authentication, enhance security, and improve user experience by allowing access to multiple applications with one set of credentials. It reduces password fatigue, streamlines IT management, and boosts productivity while maintaining robust security compliance.
