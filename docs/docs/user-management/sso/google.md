You can configure Google SSO in ToolJet at both instance and workspace level for seamless authentication and enanched security.

## Configure Google SSO

To enable GitHub Single Sign-on (SSO) for your ToolJet, follow these steps:

Role Required: <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Instance Level: **Super Admin** <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Workspace Level: **Admin**

1. Click on the settings icon (⚙️) on the bottom left of your dashboard.

2. For Instance Level: <br/>
Go to **Settings > Instance login**. <br/> 
    (Example URL - `https://app.corp.com/instance-settings/instance-login`)

    For Workspace Level: <br/>
    Go to **Workspace Settings > Workspace login**. <br/> 
    (Example URL - `https://app.corp.com/nexus/workspace-settings/workspace-login`)

3. On the right, you'll see toggles to enable SSO via different clients. All the client toggles are disabled by default. Turn on the toggle in front of Google.

4. After turning it on, a modal will appear with input fields for parameters such as Host name, Client ID, and Client secret. At the top left of the modal, there is a toggle to enable this modal. Turn it on, and then, without entering any parameters, click on the Save changes button. This will generate a Redirect URL that you will need to utilize in the Google Cloud Console.

8. You'll be led to an app registration page, fill out the required details and click on **SAVE AND CONTINUE** button at the bottom.

9. On the second page you can set OAuth scopes. Select **ADD OR REMOVE SCOPES** and add the scopes **userinfo.email** and **userinfo.profile** as shown in the image. This will allow ToolJet to store the email and name of the user who is signing in. Click on **SAVE AND CONTINUE**.
