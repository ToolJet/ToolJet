## Super Admin Reset Password

If a user forgets their password or it needs to be updated, the super admin can easily reset the password for any user in the instance by following these steps:

1. Click on the settings icon (⚙️) on the bottom left of your dashboard.

2. Go to **Settings > All Users**. <br/> 
    (Example URL - `https://app.corp.com/instance-settings/all-users`)

3. Spot the user for whose the password needs to be reset.

4. Click on the kebab icon (three dots) on the right side of the user's name and select **Reset Password**.

5. A modal will appear with two options to reset the password:

    a. **Automatically Generate Password**: Selecting this option will automatically generate a new password for the user. <br/>
    b. **Create Password**: Selecting this option will allow the Super Admin to create a new password for the user.
