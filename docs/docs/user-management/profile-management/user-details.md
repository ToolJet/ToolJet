At the instance level, Super Admins can edit a user's name or promote them to the Super Admin role. A Super Admin has access to all workspaces and inherits all the permissions of a Workspace Admin. At the workspace level, admins can update **[user roles](/docs/user-management/role-based-access/user-roles)**, **[groups](/docs/user-management/role-based-access/custom-groups)** or **[user metadata](/docs/user-management/onboard-users/user-metadata)**.
