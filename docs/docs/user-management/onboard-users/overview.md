ToolJet provides flexible options for onboarding users and a straightforward process for offboarding when needed.

## Onboarding User

Users can be added to ToolJet either through an invitation or by signing up.

### Inviting User

Admins can onboard users by sending invitations, either:
- **Individually**: Send a personalized invitation to a single user by entering their email address. For detailed steps, refer **[Inviting User](/docs/user-management/onboard-users/invite-user)** guide.
- **In Bulk**: Upload a CSV file containing user details to invite multiple users at once. For detailed steps, refer **[Bulk Inviting User](/docs/user-management/onboard-users/bulk-invite-users)** guide.

Invited users will receive an email to join the ToolJet workspace.

### User Sign-Up

Admins can enable the **[sign-up](/docs/user-management/onboard-users/self-signup-user)** feature, allowing users to register themselves. By sharing the login URL, users can create their accounts and join the workspace without needing an invitation. For more details refer 

## Offboarding User

To offboard users, admins can **[archive](#)** the user accounts. When archived the user’s access to the workspace/instance is disabled while preserving their data. <br/>
Archived accounts can be **[unarchived](#)** anytime, restoring the user’s access and roles.
