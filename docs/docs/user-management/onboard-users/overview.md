ToolJet provides flexible options for onboarding users and a straightforward process for offboarding users when needed.

## Onboarding Users

Users can be added to ToolJet either through an invitation or by signing up.

### Inviting Users

Admin users can onboard users by sending invitations:
- **Individually**: Send a personalized invitation to a single user by entering their email address. For detailed steps, refer to the **[Invite User](/docs/user-management/onboard-users/invite-user)** guide.
- **In Bulk**: Upload a CSV file containing user details to invite multiple users at once. For detailed steps, refer to the **[Bulk Invite Users](/docs/user-management/onboard-users/bulk-invite-users)** guide.

Invited users will receive an email to join the ToolJet workspace.

### User Sign-Up

Admin users can enable the sign-up feature, allowing users to register themselves. By sharing the login URL, users can create their accounts and join the workspace without needing an invitation. For more details, refer to the **[Sign-Up Users](/docs/user-management/onboard-users/self-signup-user)** Guide.

## Offboarding Users

To offboard users, admins can **[archive](/docs/user-management/onboard-users/archive-user#steps-to-archive-user)** the user accounts. When archived, the user’s access to the workspace/instance is disabled while preserving their data. <br/>
Archived accounts can be **[unarchived](/docs/user-management/onboard-users/archive-user#steps-to-unarchive-user)** at any time, restoring the user’s access and roles.
