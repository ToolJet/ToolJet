In ToolJet, the sign-up feature lets admins enable direct user registration via a sign-up URL, eliminating the need for invitations. For Self-Hosted version, the enable sign-up can be done at both instance level and workspace level. 

## Enable Sign-Up at Instance Level

Role Required: **Super Admin** <br/>

Super admin can enable sign-up at instance level, and whenever a user joins an instance using the self sign-up, a new personal workspace is created for that user and the workspace admin role will be assigned to the user.

Follow the steps to enable sign-up at instance level:

1. Click on the settings icon (⚙️) on the bottom left of your dashboard.

2. Go to **Settings > Manage instance settings**. <br/> 
    (Example URL - `https://app.corp.com/instance-settings/manage-instance-settings`)

3. Ensure that you have allowed personal workspace.

4. Now, go to **Instance login** tab. <br/> 
    (Example URL - `https://app.corp.com/instance-settings/instance-login`)

5. Enter allowed domains that can access the workspace, you can enter multiple domain names separated by comma. <br/>
If you don't enter allowed domain then anyone with the login URL can sign-up to the workspace.

## Enable Sign-Up at Workspace Level

    (Example URL - `https://app.corp.com/nexus/workspace-settings/workspace-login`)
