In ToolJet the admins can enable self sign-up feature, where do don't need to invite the user and the users can sign-up using the sign-up URL.

Follow these steps to enable self sign-up:
1. Go to **Workspace settings > Workspace login**
2. Enter allowed domains that can access the workspace, you can enter multiple domain names separated by comma.
If you don't enter allowed domain then anyone with the login URL can sign-up to the workspace.
