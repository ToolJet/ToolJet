Using **Component Properties**, you can define how a component looks, behaves, or interacts with the application.

Each component has its own set of properties based on its functionality. Here’s an overview of common types of configurable properties:

- **Labels and Data Fields**: For input components, you can configure label, add placeholders, default values, define validation rules, etc.
- **Data**: Populate components with static values or dynamic data through queries.
- **Events**: In ToolJet, events are actions or triggers that occur when a user interacts with a component or when a specific system condition is met. They let you define custom logic (like running a query, navigating to a page, or showing a toast) in response to user activity or app changes — without writing backend code.
- **Styles**: Define visual attributes like colors, spacing, alignment, and border radius to adjust how the component appears.
- **State**: Control component states such as loading, visibility, or disabled. These can be toggled manually or set programmatically using logical expressions.
- **Device**: Configure whether the component should be visible on specific devices, such as mobile or desktop.

These are just some common examples. For detailed information on any specific component and its properties, refer to the [individual component guide](#).
