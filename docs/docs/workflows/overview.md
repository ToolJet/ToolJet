## Introduction

ToolJet Workflows enables users to create complex, data-centric automations using a visual, node-based interface. It extends ToolJet's capabilities beyond building user interfaces, allowing developers and business users to automate processes, integrate data from various sources, and execute custom logic without writing extensive code.

Workflows complements the app-building features by providing a way to handle backend processes, data transformations, and integrations. This makes ToolJet a more comprehensive solution for creating internal tools and automations.

## Key Features

- **Visual, Node-Based Workflow Builder**: Design workflows intuitively by connecting nodes representing different actions and logic.
- **Integration with ToolJet Data Sources**: Seamlessly work with data from any source configured in ToolJet, including databases, APIs, and third-party services.
- **Custom JavaScript Execution**: Write and execute JavaScript code within workflows for complex data manipulation and business logic.
- **Conditional Logic and Branching**: Implement decision-making in your workflows using If condition nodes.
- **Looping and Iteration Capabilities**: Process lists of data or repeat actions using Loop nodes.
- **Extensive Node Types**: Access a variety of node types including database queries, API calls, and more to build comprehensive workflows.

## Components of a Workflow

A typical workflow in ToolJet consists of the following components:

1. **Start Node**: The entry point of the workflow, which can be triggered manually or by external events.



2. **Data Sources Nodes**: Perform operations such as database queries, API calls, or interactions with ToolJet data sources.
3. **Logic Nodes**: 
   - JavaScript nodes for custom code execution
   - If condition nodes for branching logic
   - Loop nodes for iterating over data sets
4. **Response Nodes**: Define the output of the workflow at various points. Multiple response nodes can be configured, allowing for different outputs based on the workflow's path.




ToolJet Workflows provides a powerful way to extend the capabilities of your ToolJet applications and automate complex processes. By combining the visual workflow builder with the flexibility of custom JavaScript and a wide range of integrations, you can create sophisticated automations to streamline your business operations.
