## Create New Table

To create a new table in the ToolJet Database:
 - Click on the **Create New Table** button on the top left corner of the Database editor.
 - A drawer will open from the right. Enter the details of your new table.

#### To create a new table, you'll need to:
- Enter a **Table name**.
- By default, an **id** column with **serial** data type is automatically created as the **primary key** of the table. You can change the primary key to any other column.

<img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/v2-beta/database/ux2/create-table-v2.png" alt="ToolJet database" />

- Add Columns:

| **Option** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Column name** | Enter a unique name for the column. |
| **Data type** | Select the appropriate data type for the column from the dropdown menu. For more information on available data types, see the [Supported Data Types](/docs/tooljet-db/data-types#supported-data-types) section. |
| **Default value (optional)** | Specify any default value to be assigned to the column. If left blank, the column will allow null values. |
| **Primary Key** | Check this box to designate the column as the [Primary Key](#primary-key). Multiple columns can be selected, creating a composite primary key. |
| **NULL/NOT NULL toggle** | Use this toggle to determine whether the column should allow null values or require a value. By default, null values are permitted. |
| **Unique toggle** | Click the kebab menu and toggle the **Unique** option to add a unique constraint to the column, ensuring all values are distinct. By default, duplicate values are allowed. |
| **Foreign Key** | Click the **+ Add Relation** button to establish a foreign key relationship, linking this column to a primary key or unique constraint column(s) in another table. |

## Column Constraints

ToolJet Database supports several column constraints to maintain data integrity and enforce rules on the data stored in the tables. These constraints include:

**Primary Key**: The primary key constraint ensures that the values in the designated column(s) are unique and not null across all rows in the table. It serves as a unique identifier for each record in the table.

**Foreign Key**: The foreign key constraint establishes a link between the data in two tables, ensuring referential integrity. It requires that the values in the foreign key column(s) of the source table match the values in the primary key or unique constraint column(s) of the target table.
 - Source Table: The current table on which constraint is to be added.
 - Target Table: The table that contains the column to be referenced.

**Unique**: The unique constraint ensures that the values in the designated column(s) are unique across all rows in the table, allowing for null values.

**Not Null**: The not null constraint ensures that the designated column(s) cannot have null values, requiring a value for every row in the table.

For a detailed overview of which constraints are allowed for each data type, refer to the [Permissible Constraints per Data Type](/docs/tooljet-db/data-types#permissible-constraints-per-data-type) table.

## Adding and Modifying Data

### Add New Data

The Add new data button on the top of the table editor allows you to add data to the table. You can either **[Add new row](#add-new-row)** or **[Bulk upload data](#bulk-upload-data)** to add the data to the table.

<img style={{marginBottom:'15px'}} className="screenshot-full" src="/img/v2-beta/database/ux2/add-new-data-v2.png" alt="ToolJet database" />

### Add New Row

To add a new row to a table, either click on the `Add new data` button on top and then select the **Add new row** option or click on the **+** button present at the bottom left.<br/>
A drawer from the right will open up where the values for the new row can be provided.

<img style={{marginBottom:'15px'}} className="screenshot-full" src="/img/v2-beta/database/ux2/add-new-row-v2.gif" alt="ToolJet database"/>

### Edit Row

To edit a row, hover on the row that you want to edit and the expand icon will appear next to the checkbox of that row. Click on the Expand icon to open the drawer and edit the row.

### Bulk Upload Data

You can bulk upload data to the ToolJet database by clicking the **Bulk upload data** button at the top of the database editor. On clicking the button, a drawer will open from the right from where you can upload a **CSV** file. This file is used to insert records onto the table. If data for the id column is missing, it will insert a new record with the row data; if the id is present, it will update the corresponding record with the row data.

From the drawer, users can download the **template CSV file** in which they can enter the data to be uploaded to the ToolJet database's table or format their CSV file in the same way as the template file.

Once the CSV file is ready, click on the file picker to select the file or drag and drop the file in the file picker. Now, click on the **Upload data** button to upload the data to the ToolJet database.

**Requirements**:
- The data types of columns in the CSV file should match those in the ToolJet database table.
- The `id` column with a `serial` data type should not contain duplicate values.
- All the column constraints should be satisfied. For example, if a column is marked as `Unique`, it should not contain duplicate values in the CSV file.

**Limitations**:
- There is a limit of 1000 rows per CSV file that can be uploaded to the ToolJet database.
- The CSV file should not exceed 2MB in size.

:::info
You can overcome the above limitations in the self-hosted version by adding the following environment variables:
- `TOOLJET_DB_BULK_UPLOAD_MAX_ROWS`: Specifies the maximum number of rows that can be uploaded. The default is 1,000 rows.
- `TOOLJET_DB_BULK_UPLOAD_MAX_CSV_FILE_SIZE_MB`: Specifies the maximum CSV file size for bulk uploads. The default maximum size is 5 MB.

## Filter

### Add Filter

You can add as many filters as you want into the table by clicking on the **Filter** button present on the top of the database editor.

#### Adding a filter on the table data
- Select a **column** from the Columns dropdown.
- Choose an **[operation](#available-operations-are)**.
- Enter a **value** for the selected operation.

#### Available operations are:
| **Operation** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **equals** | This operation is used to check if the value of the column is equal to the value entered in the input field. |
| **greater than** | This operation is used to check if the value of the column is greater than the value entered in the input field. |
| **greater than or equal** | This operation is used to check if the value of the column is greater than or equal to the value entered in the input field. |
| **less than** | This operation is used to check if the value of the column is less than the value entered in the input field. |
| **less than or equal** | This operation is used to check if the value of the column is less than or equal to the value entered in the input field. |
| **not equal** | This operation is used to check if the value of the column is not equal to the value entered in the input field. |
| **like** | This operation is used to check if the value of the column is like the value entered in the input field. This operation is case-sensitive. ex: `ToolJet` will not match `tooljet` |
| **ilike** | This operation is used to check if the value of the column is like the value entered in the input field. This operation is case-insensitive. ex: `ToolJet` will match `tooljet` |
| **match** | This operation is used to check if the value of the column is like the value entered in the input field. This operation is case-sensitive. ex: `ToolJet` will not match `tooljet`. This operation uses regular expressions. ex: `^ToolJet$` will match `ToolJet` but not `ToolJet Inc`. |
| **imatch** | This operation is used to check if the value of the column is like the value entered in the input field. This operation is case-insensitive. This operation uses regular expressions. ex: `^ToolJet$` will match `ToolJet` but not `ToolJet Inc`. |
| **in** | This operation is used to check if the value of the column is in the list of values entered in the input field. ex: `(1,2,3)` |
| **is** | This operation is used to check if the value of the column is equal to the value entered in the input field. This operation is used for boolean data types. |
