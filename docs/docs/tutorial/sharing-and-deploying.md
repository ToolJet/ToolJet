# Preview and Sharing Apps

## Preview

Clicking on `Preview` will open up the currently opened version of the app in the new tab. This is useful if you want to immediately check the app in production.

## Sharing an app

Once you have released a version of your app, you can share the app with others using a customised url. To share an app:

- Click on the **Share** button on the top-right corner

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>


<img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/tutorial/sharing/share.png" alt="share" />


</div>

- In the dialog box, turn on the toggle switch to `Make the application public` and shareable

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>


<img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/tutorial/sharing/toggle.png"  alt="toggle" />


</div>

- Create your own `customised URL` for the app and click on `copy` to copy the URL

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

<img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/tutorial/sharing/url.png" alt="url" />


</div>

- You can also `Embedd` your application using the embeddable link
