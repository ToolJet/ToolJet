:::

This tutorial will walk you through building a simple app to fetch customer information from a PostgreSQL database and display the data using the table widget.
To create a new ToolJet app, click on the **'Create App'** button on the ToolJet dashboard. 


You will redirected to the visual app editor once the app has been created. The name of the app can be changed by clicking on the app name at top-left of the app builder.

The main components of an app: 

- **Widgets** - UI components such as tables, buttons, dropdowns.
- **Data sources** - ToolJet can connect to databases, APIs and external services to fetch and modify data.
- **Queries** - Queries are used to access the connected datasources.
