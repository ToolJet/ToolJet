## Permissions

- The administrator can manage [users and groups](/docs/tutorial/manage-users-groups) of each workspace
- Applications and settings can not be shared between workspaces
- A user authorised to login to ToolJet will not have access to all workspaces, User should be invited or signed up to a workspace to access it.

## Enabling Multi-Workspace

Set environment variable **DISABLE_MULTI_WORKSPACE** value to **false** to enable the feature, and **true** to disable it.

### When enabled

- When Multi-Workspace feature is enabled, user should login with username and password to log in to ToolJet.
- Administrator can configure authentication methods for their workspaces.
- If password login is enabled, switching to the workspace will happen without any other authorization since the user is already authorized with password login.
- User logged in to TooJet and trying to switch to a workspace where SSO is enabled and password login is disabled, will be redirected to workspace login page and enabled SSO options will be shown
- User can directly login to a workspace using workspace login URL, Administrator can view the URL **Manage SSO -> General Settings -> Login URL**.

### When disabled

- If Multi-Workspace is disabled, Create workspace feature wonâ€™t be available.
- No separate login page for workspace and SSO configured for the workspace will be reflected to the main login page/login.
