title: Set page variable

Page variables can only be accessed within a page on which they are created, unlike normal variables that can be accessed throughout the application.

Use this action to create a variable and assign a `value` to it in the [Multipage Apps](/docs/tutorial/pages).

Debounce field is empty by default, you can enter a numerical value to specify the time in milliseconds after which the action will be performed. ex: `300`

:::info
You can also trigger actions from the **JavaScript code**. Check it out [here](/docs/how-to/run-actions-from-runjs).
