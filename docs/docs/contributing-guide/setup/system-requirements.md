This page details the system requirements for setting up and running ToolJet on both Docker local and Bare-Metal setups. 

## Docker 

**Windows:**

When configuring Docker Desktop on your Windows machine, ensure you have a minimum of 16GB RAM for optimal performance.


**Mac:**

For Docker setups on Mac systems, it's advisable to use a machine with 16GB RAM to enhance operational efficiency.


## Bare-Metal Setup

For those who prefer a [bare-metal](https://docs.tooljet.com/docs/contributing-guide/setup/docker) setup over Docker, a minimum of 8GB RAM is recommended for smooth operation.

Before initiating the installation process, please verify that your system meets these specified requirements. It's essential to customize server specifications based on the unique demands of your deployment scenario.
