This guide outlines the development life cycle for ToolJet deployments, explaining its importance and how ToolJet manages it efficiently.

A development life cycle (also known as the software development life cycle or SDLC) is a structured framework that ensures software is built, deployed, and maintained efficiently. It helps teams manage changes, collaborate effectively, and maintain stability in production environments. A well-defined development life cycle enhances software quality, improves efficiency, facilitates better collaboration between teams, reduces costs by catching issues early, and ensures long-term maintainability.

## Development Life Cycle in ToolJet

ToolJet enables teams to manage application changes and deployments effectively through its Environment and Version Management system. Key aspects of managing the development life cycle in ToolJet include:

### Version Control
    
- Use the [**Version Control**](http://s) feature in the App Builder to track and manage changes.
        
- Use [**GitSync**](http://s) to integrate with your Git repository and maintain application versions
        

### Release Management 

### Environment Management
ToolJet comes with three predefined environments: **development, staging, and production**. These environments apply to applications, data sources, and constants, ensuring controlled testing before deployment.For more details, refer to the [Environments Documentation](http://s)
    

### Multi-Instance Environments
You can deploy multiple ToolJet instances where each acts as a different environment. This setup isolates all resources as well as users across the instances. For more details, refer to the [Multi-Instance Environments](http://h) Documentation.
