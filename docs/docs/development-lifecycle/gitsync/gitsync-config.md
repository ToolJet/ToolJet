To configure GitSync with ToolJet, you will need the SSH URL from the Git repository manager and must authenticate the SSH key, which is generated by ToolJet, with the repository manager. In this guide, we will explore how to configure GitSync using GitHub as the repository manager. For more information on using other repository managers, such as GitLab or Gitea, refer to the **[SSH Configuration for Git Repo Manager](#)** guide.

## Setting up GitSync in ToolJet

Role Required: **Admin**

### 1. Get SSH URL from Git Repo Manager


1. **Create a New Repository** <br/>
    Create a new repository on your GitHub. The repository can be public or private. You can also use an existing repository. Make sure that the repository is empty, without a readme file and the default branch name should be **master**.

2. **Obtain the SSH URL** <br/>
    When a repository is created, GitHub shows a screen with the SSH URL. If the repository is already created, you can obtain the URL by clicking on the **Clone or download** button.

To generate the SSH URL for other git repository manager, such as GitLab and Gitea, follow the **[SSH Configuration](/docs/release-management/gitsync/ssh-config#generating-ssh-url)** guide.

### 2. Configure the GitSync Feature on ToolJet

    1. Go to the **Workspace settings**, and click on the **Configure git** tab.

    2. Enter the **SSH URL** of the repository in the **Git repo URL** field.

    3. Click on the **Generate SSH key** button, and copy the SSH key that is generated. The SSH key is used to authenticate ToolJet with the repository.

    There are two types of generated SSH keys:
    - **ED25519**: This is a secure and efficient algorithm that is used for generating SSH keys. It is recommended to use this key type. VCS providers like GitHub and GitLab recommend using this key type
    - **RSA**: This is an older algorithm that is used for generating SSH keys. It is not recommended to use this key type. Older VCS providers like Bitbucket recommend using this key type.

### 3. Deploy the SSH Key

1. Go to the **Settings** tab of the GitHub repository, and click on the **Deploy keys** tab. Click on the **Add deploy key** button.

2. Enter a title for the SSH key in the **Title** field. 
        
3. Paste the SSH key generated from the ToolJet. 

4. Make sure that the **Allow write access** checkbox is checked, especially when configuring the GitSync feature to [push changes to Git](#pushing-changes-to-git-repo). However, it is not mandatory to check this option when setting up the GitSync feature for [pulling changes from Git](#pulling-changes-from-git-repo).
        
5. Finally, click on the **Add key** button.

To deploy the SSH key for other git repository manager, such as GitLab and Gitea, follow the **[SSH Configuration](/docs/release-management/gitsync/ssh-config#deploy-the-ssh-key)** guide.

### 4. Finish the GitSync Configuration on ToolJet

After deploying the SSH Key, go to the **Configure git** tab on ToolJet, and click on the **Finalize setup** button. If the SSH key is configured correctly, you will see a success message.
