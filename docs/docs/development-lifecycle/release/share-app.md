Once the application is released, it can be accessed in multiple ways, including via a direct URL, through the ToolJet dashboard, or by embedding it into another application.

## Share Application via URL

Once the application is released, it can be accessed via a URL, and the URL slug can be customized. ToolJet also provides an option to make the application public, allowing anyone on the internet to access it without signing up for ToolJet. In contrast, private applications are restricted to workspace users with the necessary access permissions.

All released versions of the application are accessible through the same URL, ensuring a consistent access point regardless of version updates.

## Access Application via Dashboard

Users can launch the released version of the application from the dashboard. The application can also be hidden from the dashboard for end users. Refer to the **[Access Control](#)** guide for more details.

### Folders

On the dashboard, applications can be organized and managed by creating folders.

## Embed Application

ToolJet applications can be embedded into other web applications using iframes. To embed an application, make the app public, after which ToolJet will automatically generate an iframe code snippet for integration.
