Version Control in ToolJet helps track changes, maintain a history of application updates, enable **[recovery and rollback](#)**, and deploy updates systematically. It ensures stability, and allows seamless rollouts of new features or fixes.

For example, after deploying a new payment gateway integration in version v1.2.0, users report checkout failures due to a misconfigured API endpoint. Using ToolJetâ€™s versioning, the team quickly rolls back to the stable version v1.1.0, restoring functionality within minutes. This minimizes downtime, preserves transaction data, and allows developers to debug the faulty version offline without disrupting users.

## Creating a Version

You can create new versions from App Version Manager in the top. It displays the current version of the app and can be used to switch between the different versions of the app. To create a new version:

1. Go to the **App Version Manager** from the toolbar and click on the dropdown. It will display all the available versions of the app. The released version name will be in green color.

2. Click on **Create new version** button at the bottom of the dropdown and a modal will pop-up. 

3. Enter a **Version Name**.

4. Select the **Create version from** dropdown that will include all the versions of the app, choose a version from the dropdown that you want to use for your new version or ToolJet will automatically select the last created version.

5. Click on **Create new version** button to add a new version.
