Exposed Variables help in accessing and manipulating data within components. These variables are automatically created and updated as users interact with the application. Whether it's capturing text from a text editor or retrieving selections from a dropdown menu, exposed variables are integral for dynamic data handling in ToolJet applications.

## Accessing Exposed Variables
Each component in ToolJet has its own set of exposed variables, which hold specific data related to that component. For example, in the Text Input component, the `value` variable is used. This variable is updated every time a user enters something in the text editor. It can be dynamically accessed using JavaScript notation: `{{components.textinput1.value}}`. This feature allows developers to easily track and utilize the data entered by users in real-time.
