## Permissions

:::tip
Please check the detailed doc on **[Permissions](/docs/org-management/permissions)**.
:::

- Administrators can manage [users and groups](/docs/tutorial/manage-users-groups) of each workspace.
- Applications and settings cannot be shared between workspaces.
- Users authorised to login to ToolJet will not have access to all workspaces. Users must be invited to or sign up for a workspace before they can log in.
- When the Multi-Workspace feature is enabled, users must log in with a username and password.
- Administrators can configure authentication methods for their workspaces.
- If password login is enabled, switching to the workspace will happen without any other authorization since the user is already authorized with password login.
- If a user is logged into ToolJet and switches to a workspace that only uses Single Sign-On (SSO), the user will be sent to a login page to select an SSO option.
- Users can directly login to a workspace using workspace login URL. Administrators can view the URL in the Workspace Settings under **SSO -> General Settings -> Login URL**.

### Disabling Workspace Creation (Super Admin)
- Only **[Super Admins](/docs/Enterprise/superadmin#restrict-creation-of-personal-workspace-of-users)** can disable the option for creating personal workspaces for a user.
- If the option to make personal workspaces is turned off for a user, the user won't be able to create new workspaces.
