# Upload files using GCS

ToolJetâ€™s support uploading files, we are going to create an interface to upload PDFs to GCS

Before adding the new data source we will need to have a private key for our GCS bucket and it has the correct rights.

## Setting up Google Cloud Storage data source

1. From our application in tooljet go to  **left sidebar** to sources.
2. Add a new GCS source from the  **APIs list.**
3. Test the connection
4. Save it, we will use it later

## Adding a file picker

1. Drag a drop the file picker to your app
2. Configure the file picker to fit our needs
- Change the: **Accept file types** to `{{"application/pdf"}}` so we will only accept pdf files. In case we will like to accept any file type just **leave it in blank**
- Change the **Max file count** to one as we are only going to upload 1 file at a time.

:::info
 File types must be valid [MIME](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types) type according to input element specification or a valid file extension.

 To accept any/all file type(s), set `Accept file types` to an empty value.
