| Text |  This property sets the content/text inside the Text widget. Refer your query data with dynamic variables `{{queries.datasource.data.text}}` or populate it with sample values `Text goes here !` |
 Loading state | Shows a loading status if the value is `true`. This property is often used with the `isLoading` property of queries so that the table shows a spinner while the query is being run. Default value is `false`.|
