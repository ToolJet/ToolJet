The **Table** component displays and manages data, connecting seamlessly with databases and APIs. It allows users to view and edit data directly within the table. This document goes through all the properties related to the **Table** component.

## Data

To populate the **Table** component with data, you need to provide the data in the form of an array of objects under its **Data** property. You can utilize data from queries by referring query data to populate the **Table**. 

The **Table** component will **automatically generate all the required columns** when the data is provided. The **Table** also loads one level of **nested data**. 

Example - Passing an array:

```js
{{[{ id: 1, name: 'Sarah', email: 'sarah@example.com', contact:{number: 8881212, address: '25, Huntley Road, Newark'} }]}}
```

Example - Passing a query data:

```js
{{queries.restapi1.data}}
//replace restapi1 with your query name
```

## Columns

Go to the **[Table Columns](/docs/widgets/table/table-columns)** guide to know more about supported column types.

## Action Buttons

<br/><br/>

Action buttons are positioned in the Table's final column. These buttons' appearance can be customized, and specific actions can be defined for when they are clicked using the `On click` action. Upon clicking an action button, the `selectedRow` exposed variable of the Table is updated to reflect the data of the selected row.

Below are the button text properties that you can set. 

| <div style={{ width:"170px"}}> Property </div> | Description |
| :------- | :----------- |
| Button text | Sets the text that you want to be displayed on the action button. |
| Button position | Sets the button position to left or right. |
| Background color | Sets the background color of the action button. |
| Text color | Sets the color of button-text of the action button. |
| Disable Action Button | Toggle on to disable the action button. You can programmatically set its value by clicking on the **fx** button next to it, if set to `{{true}}`, the action button will be disabled and becomes non-functional. By default, its value is set to `{{false}}`. |
| New event handler | The **New event handler** button lets you create an event handler to define behavior for action buttons based on the `On click` action. |

## Events

| <div style={{ width:"150px"}}> Event </div> | Description |
|:-------|:-------------|
| Row hovered | This event is activated when the mouse pointer hovers over a row. The `hoveredRowId` variable captures the ID of the hovered row, and the `hoveredRow` variable stores the row's data in object format. |
| Row clicked | This event is triggered when a Table row is clicked. The `selectedRowId` and `selectedRow` exposed variables of the Table store the ID and data of the selected row, respectively. |
| Save changes | If any cell of the Table is edited, the **Save changes** button appears at the footer of the Table. Save changes event is triggered when this button is clicked. |
| Page changed | If server-side pagination is enabled, this event is fired when the current page is changed. Page changed event is triggered after updating the `pageIndex` variable. |
| Search | Search event is triggered when a text is entered to the search input box of the Table. `searchText` variable is updated before triggering this event. |
| Cancel changes | If any cell of the Table is edited, the **Discard changes** button appears at the footer of the Table. Cancel changes event is triggered when this button is clicked.|
| Sort applied | This event is triggered when the column name header is clicked to apply sorting. The `sortApplied` variable is updated with an object having `column` and `direction` values. |
| Cell value changed | If any cell of the Table is edited, the cell value changed event is triggered. |
| Filter changed | Triggeres when filter is added, removed, or updated. `filters` variable of the Table is updated to reflect the status of filters applied. The objects will have properties: `condition`, `value`, and `column`. |
| Add new rows | Triggeres when the **Save** button is clicked from the Add new row modal.  |

## Row Selection

| <div style={{ width:"170px"}}> Property </div> | Description |
|:-------|:-------------|
| Allow selection | Enables row selection using checkboxes. Disabling it removes row highlighting and bulk selection options. |
| Highlight selected row | Highlights the last clicked row. Replaces checkbox selection with visual highlight. |
| Bulk selection | Allows selecting multiple rows on the current page. Selected values are stored in the selectedRows variable. |
| Default selected row | Pre-selects a row when Allow selection is enabled. Use a key-value object like `{"id": variables.x}` where x is a valid variable that returns ID. |
| Select row on cell edit | Automatically selects the row being edited if column is editable. Disable to prevent auto-selection during editing. |

## Search, Sort and Filter

<img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/widgets/table/searchsort.png" alt="ToolJet - Component Reference - Table" /> 


### Show search

The Show search property controls the search box on the Table. Client-side search is enabled by default and server-side search can be enabled from the events section of the inspector. Whenever the search text is changed, the `searchText` exposed variable of the Table component is updated. 
 

#### Server-side search

If server-side search is enabled, `Search` event is fired after the content of `searchText` variable is changed. `searchText` can be used to run a specific query to search for the records in your data source.

### Enable column sorting

Disable this option to lock the sorting of columns when the users clicks on the column header.

#### Server-side sort
When server-side sort is enabled, clicking on the column headers will not automatically sort the table, instead, the `Sort applied` event will be fired and the applied sorting will be accessible in the `sortApplied` exposed variable. This information can be leveraged to execute queries that update the table content in accordance with the specified sorting.

### Enable filtering

The filter button in the Table header is visible by default. You can choose to hide it by disabling this option. 

The Table data can be filtered using the Filter data option on its top-left. You have the option to choose from various filters, such as:

- **contains**
- **does not contain**
- **matches**
- **does not match**
- **equals**
- **does not equal**
- **is empty**
- **is not empty**
- **greater than**
- **greater than or equal to**
- **less than**
- **less than or equal to**

#### Server-side filter
When Server-side filter is enabled, applying filters will not automatically filter the table, instead, the `Filter changed` event will be fired and the applied filters will be accessible in the `filters` exposed variables. This data can be utilized to execute queries that update the table content according to the applied filters.


## Pagination

Pagination helps manage the display of large data sets by dividing them into manageable segments. Client-side pagination is enabled by default. When enabled, an additional property, **Number of rows per page**, becomes available to set the number of records per page. The default value is set to 10; if disabled, all records will appear on a single page.

#### Server-side pagination

Server-side pagination can be used to run a query whenever the page is changed. Under events section, you can use the `Page changed` event to execute a query and along with the `pageIndex` exposed variable. `pageIndex` can be used to query the next set of results when page is changed.

When Server-side pagination is enabled, you'll be able to set three other Table properties:
- **Enable previous page button**: Toggle this off to disable the previous page button from the Table.
- **Enable next page button**: Toggle this off to disable the next page button from the Table.
- **Total records server side**: Set a numerical value to display particular number of records.
