This guide explains how to perform serverside pagination on a **Table** component in ToolJet.

## Add Table Component

Before performing the serverside pagination, lets setup the **Table** component and populate it with the data:

1. Drag a **Table** component from right component library to the canvas.
2. Select the data source and create a new query from the query panel at the bottom. (Refer to [data source](/docs/data-sources/overview) docs for more details) <br/>
    We are going to use ToolJetâ€™s Sample data source (Postgres) in this guide.<br/>
    Add the following query to fetch the data from database:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM public.sample_data_orders
    LIMIT 100
    ```

3. Set the value of the **Data** property of the **Table** to `{{queries.<query_name>.data}}` to populate the **Table** with relevant data.

## Serverside Pagination

Follow the following steps to perform server side pagination on **Table**:

1. Enable Server Side Pagination under the **Table** properties.

2. Create a new query to find total number of records on server side

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.sample_data_orders
    ```

    <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/widgets/table/serverside-operations/pagiation-count.png" alt="Fetch data from the data source" />

3. Navigate to the table's properties under Pagination section, in Total record server side enter `{{queries.countOrders.data[0].count}}` 
    
    <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/widgets/table/serverside-operations/pagiation-total-record.png" alt="Fetch data from the data source" />
    
    Make sure to change *countOrders* with your query name create in the last step.
    
4. Edit the query, as follow:
    
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM public.sample_data_orders
    LIMIT 100 OFFSET {{(components.table1.pageIndex-1)*100}}
    ```
    
    <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/widgets/table/serverside-operations/pagiation-query.png" alt="Fetch data from the data source" />
    
    **Note**: Make sure to replace *table1* with your **Table** name.
    
5. Add Event Handler in **Table**:<br/>
    Event: **Page changed**<br/>
    Action: **Run Query**<br/>
    Query: **Select Your Query**
    
    <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/widgets/table/serverside-operations/pagiation-eh.png" alt="Fetch data from the data source" />
    
    This will run the query and fetch the data every time the page is changed.
    
6. Disable the next page button on the last page, navigate to the **Table** properties under Pagination section. Click on the **fx** icon next to Ebable next page button and enter `{{components.table1.pageIndex<queries.countOrders.data[0].count/100}}` in the field.
    
    <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/widgets/table/serverside-operations/pagiation-next-page.png" alt="Fetch data from the data source" />
    
7. Add Loading State, navigate to the table's properties under Additional Actions. Click on the **fx** icon next to Loading State and enter `{{queries.getOrders.isLoading}}` in the field.

    **Note**: Make sure to replace *getOrders* with your query name.

This is how serverside pagination is implemented in ToolJet's **Table** component. When pagination is used, the query is executed on the server, retrieving only the relevant set of records for the current page. This ensures that data is fetched efficiently from the server, rather than loading the entire dataset at once, improving performance and scalability.
