This guide explains how to perform serverside sort operation on a **Table** component in ToolJet.

## Add Table Component

Before performing the sort operation, lets setup the **Table** component and populate it with the data:

1. Drag a **Table** component from right component library to the canvas.
2. Select the data source and create a new query from the query panel at the bottom. (Refer to [data source](/docs/data-sources/overview) docs for more details) <br/>
    We are going to use ToolJetâ€™s Sample data source (Postgres) in this guide.<br/>
    Add the following query to fetch the data from database:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM public.sample_data_orders
    LIMIT 100
    ```

3. Set the value of the **Data** property of the **Table** to `{{queries.<query_name>.data}}` to populate the **Table** with relevant data.

## Serverside Sort

Follow the following steps to perform server side sort operation on **Table**:

1. Enable Server Side Sort under the **Table** properties.

2. Edit the query, as follow:

    ```sql
    SELECT * 
    FROM public.sample_data_orders 
    {{components.table1.sortApplied ? `
        ORDER BY ${components.table1.sortApplied[0].column} 
        ${components.table1.sortApplied[0].direction}
    ` : ""}} 
    LIMIT 100
    ```

    **Note**: Make sure to replace *table1* with your **Table** name.

3. Add Event Handler in **Table**:<br/>
    Event: **Sort applied**<br/>
    Action: **Run Query**<br/>
    Query: **Select Your Query**

    <img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/widgets/table/serverside-operations/sort-eh.png" alt="Fetch data from the data source" />

    This will run the query and fetch the data every time a sort is applied.

4. Add Loading State, navigate to the **Table** properties under Additional Actions. Click on the **fx** icon next to Loading State and enter `{{queries.getOrders.isLoading}}` in the field.

    Note: Make sure to replace *getOrders* with your query name.

This is how serverside sort operation is implemented in ToolJet's **Table** component. When sorting is applied to a column in the **Table**, the query is executed on the server, enabling sorting across the entire dataset. This ensures that the sorting is not limited to the data loaded into the **Table** but covers all records in the database.
