# List view

List view widget allows to create a list of repeatable rows of data. Just like a container widget, you can nest other widgets inside of it and control how many times they repeat.

</div>

:::caution Restricted components
In order to avoid excessively complex situations, certain components, namely **Calendar** and **Kanban**, are restricted from being placed within the list view component using drag-and-drop functionality.

If the builder attempts to add any of the aforementioned components inside the List view, an error message will be displayed:

`<Restricted component> cannot be used as a child component within the list view.`
:::

## Events

To attach an event handler to the list view component, follow these steps:
1. Click on the component handle to open its properties on the right sidebar.
2. Navigate to the **Events** section.
3. Click on the **+Add handler** button.

There are two events that you can use with the List View component:
- **[Row clicked (Deprecated)](#row-clicked)**
- **[Record clicked](#record-clicked)**

</div>

### Row clicked

The **Row clicked** event is triggered when any row inside the list view is clicked. Similar to other events in ToolJet, you can define multiple actions for this event.

When a row is clicked in the list view component, certain related data is made available through the **selectedRowId** and **selectedRow** variables. For the list view component's available exposed variables, refer to the **[here](#exposed-variables)** section.

:::warning
The Row clicked event is being deprecated, so it is recommended to use the **Record Clicked** event instead.
:::

### Record clicked

The **Record clicked** event is similar to the row click event, as it is triggered whenever an interaction is made with a record in the component.

When a record is clicked in the list view component, relevant data is exposed through the **selectedRecordId** and **selectedRecord** variables. For the list view component's available exposed variables, refer to the **[here](#exposed-variables)** section.

:::info
To get detailed information about all the **Actions**, please consult the [Action Reference](/docs/category/actions-reference) documentation.

### General
#### Tooltip

A Tooltip is often used to specify extra information about something when the user hovers the mouse pointer over the widget.

Under the <b>General</b> accordion, you can set the value in the string format. Now hovering over the widget will display the string as the tooltip.

## Example: Displaying data in the list view

- Let's start by creating a new app and then dragging the List view widget onto the canvas.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

<img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/widgets/list-view/emptylist.png" alt="ToolJet - List view widget" />

</div>

- Now lets create a query and select the REST API from the datasource dropdown. Choose the `GET` method and enter the API endpoint - `https://reqres.in/api/users?page=1`. Save this query and fire it. Inspect the query results from the left sidebar, you'll see that it resulted in the `data` object having an array of objects.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

<img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/widgets/list-view/data.gif" alt="ToolJet - List view widget" />

</div>


- Now lets edit the `List data` property of the list view widget for displaying the query data. We will use JS to get the data from the query - `{{queries.restapi1.data.data}}`. Here the last `data` is a data object that includes an array of objects, the first `data` is the data resulted from the `restapi1` query. This will automatically create the rows in the widget using the data.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

<img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/widgets/list-view/datadisplay.png" alt="ToolJet - List view widget" />

</div>


- Finally, we will need to nest widgets into the first row of list view widget and the widget will automatically create the subsequent instances. The subsequent rows will appear the same way you'll display the data in the first row.

</div>


:::tip

Use `{{listItem.key}}` to display data on the nested widgets. Example: For displaying the images we used `{{listItem.avatar}}` where **avatar** is one of the key in the objects from the query result.

## Exposed Variables

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

<img className="screenshot-full" src="/img/widgets/list-view/exposedvars.png" alt="ToolJet - List view widget" />

</div>

| **Variables**    | **Description** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **data** | This variable stores the data loaded into the list view component. You can retrieve the data of each record in the list view using `{{components.listview1.data["0"].text1.text}}` |
| **selectedRowId** (deprecated) | This variable holds the ID of the clicked row in the list view. The row ID starts from `0`. You can access the selectedRowId using `{{components.listview1.selectedRowId}}` |
| **selectedRow** (deprecated) | This variable contains the data of the components within the selected row. You can access the data using `{{components.listview1.selectedRow.text1}}` |
| **selectedRecordId** | This variable holds the ID of the clicked record in the list view. The record ID starts from `0`. You can access the selectedRecordId using `{{components.listview1.selectedRecordId}}` |
| **selectedRow** | This variable stores the data of the components within the selected record. You can access the data using `{{components.listview1.selectedRecord.text1}}` |

## Component specific actions (CSA)

There are currently no CSA (Component-Specific Actions) implemented to regulate or control the component.
