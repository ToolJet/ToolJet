1,Tags on paid features during trial period,"Currently, there are tags to indicate which features are paid in the basic plan which are not shown when a user is on a paid plan. However, when a user is on their trial period, they have all paid plan features available but there's not way for the user to know which features they will miss out on if they do not upgrade. Hence, paid feature tags are implemented in the trial period as well.",v2.28.4-ee2.15.0,Improvement,,https://img.freepik.com/free-vector/man-signing-contract-with-big-pen_74855-10909.jpg,,"Jan 16, 2025"
